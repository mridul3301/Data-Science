      "YOU don't know about me without you have read a book by the name of The\n",
      "Adventures of Tom Sawyer; but that ain't no matter.  That book was made\n",
      "by Mr. Mark Twain, and he told the truth, mainly.  There was things\n",
      "which he stretched, but mainly he told the truth.  That is nothing.  I\n",
      "never seen anybody but lied one time or another, without it was Aunt\n",
      "Polly, or the widow, or maybe Mary.  Aunt Polly--Tom's Aunt Polly, she\n",
      "is--and Mary, and the Widow Douglas is all told about in that book, which\n",
      "is mostly a true book, with some stretchers, as I said before.\n",
      "\n",
      "Now the way that the book winds up is this:  Tom and me found the money\n",
      "that the robbers hid in the cave, and it made us rich.  We got six\n",
      "thousand dollars apiece--all gold.  It was an awful sight of money when\n",
      "it was piled up.  Well, Judge Thatcher he took it and put it out\n",
      "at interest, and it fetched us a dollar a day apiece all the year\n",
      "round--more than a body could tell what to do with.  The Widow Douglas\n",
      "she took me for her son, and allowed she would sivilize me; but it was\n",
      "rough living in the house all the time, considering how dismal regular\n",
      "and decent the widow was in all her ways; and so when I couldn't stand\n",
      "it no longer I lit out.  I got into my old rags and my sugar-hogshead\n",
      "again, and was free and satisfied.  But Tom Sawyer he hunted me up and\n",
      "said he was going to start a band of robbers, and I might join if I\n",
      "would go back to the widow and be respectable.  So I went back.\n",
      "\n",
      "The widow she cried over me, and called me a poor lost lamb, and she\n",
      "called me a lot of other names, too, but she never meant no harm by\n",
      "it. She put me in them new clothes again, and I couldn't do nothing but\n",
      "sweat and sweat, and feel all cramped up.  Well, then, the old thing\n",
      "commenced again.  The widow rung a bell for supper, and you had to come\n",
      "to time. When you got to the table you couldn't go right to eating, but\n",
      "you had to wait for the widow to tuck down her head and grumble a little\n",
      "over the victuals, though there warn't really anything the matter with\n",
      "them,--that is, nothing only everything was cooked by itself.  In a\n",
      "barrel of odds and ends it is different; things get mixed up, and the\n",
      "juice kind of swaps around, and the things go better.\n",
      "\n",
      "After supper she got out her book and learned me about Moses and the\n",
      "Bulrushers, and I was in a sweat to find out all about him; but by and\n",
      "by she let it out that Moses had been dead a considerable long time; so\n",
      "then I didn't care no more about him, because I don't take no stock in\n",
      "dead people.\n",
      "\n",
      "Pretty soon I wanted to smoke, and asked the widow to let me.  But she\n",
      "wouldn't.  She said it was a mean practice and wasn't clean, and I must\n",
      "try to not do it any more.  That is just the way with some people.  They\n",
      "get down on a thing when they don't know nothing about it.  Here she was\n",
      "a-bothering about Moses, which was no kin to her, and no use to anybody,\n",
      "being gone, you see, yet finding a power of fault with me for doing a\n",
      "thing that had some good in it.  And she took snuff, too; of course that\n",
      "was all right, because she done it herself.\n",
      "\n",
      "Her sister, Miss Watson, a tolerable slim old maid, with goggles on,\n",
      "had just come to live with her, and took a set at me now with a\n",
      "spelling-book. She worked me middling hard for about an hour, and then\n",
      "the widow made her ease up.  I couldn't stood it much longer.  Then for\n",
      "an hour it was deadly dull, and I was fidgety.  Miss Watson would say,\n",
      "\"Don't put your feet up there, Huckleberry;\" and \"Don't scrunch up\n",
      "like that, Huckleberry--set up straight;\" and pretty soon she would\n",
      "say, \"Don't gap and stretch like that, Huckleberry--why don't you try to\n",
      "behave?\"  Then she told me all about the bad place, and I said I wished\n",
      "I was there. She got mad then, but I didn't mean no harm.  All I wanted\n",
      "was to go somewheres; all I wanted was a change, I warn't particular.\n",
      " She said it was wicked to say what I said; said she wouldn't say it for\n",
      "the whole world; she was going to live so as to go to the good place.\n",
      " Well, I couldn't see no advantage in going where she was going, so I\n",
      "made up my mind I wouldn't try for it.  But I never said so, because it\n",
      "would only make trouble, and wouldn't do no good.\n",
      "\n",
      "Now she had got a start, and she went on and told me all about the good\n",
      "place.  She said all a body would have to do there was to go around all\n",
      "day long with a harp and sing, forever and ever.  So I didn't think\n",
      "much of it. But I never said so.  I asked her if she reckoned Tom Sawyer\n",
      "would go there, and she said not by a considerable sight.  I was glad\n",
      "about that, because I wanted him and me to be together.\n",
      "\n",
      "Miss Watson she kept pecking at me, and it got tiresome and lonesome.\n",
      " By and by they fetched the niggers in and had prayers, and then\n",
      "everybody was off to bed.  I went up to my room with a piece of candle,\n",
      "and put it on the table.  Then I set down in a chair by the window and\n",
      "tried to think of something cheerful, but it warn't no use.  I felt\n",
      "so lonesome I most wished I was dead.  The stars were shining, and the\n",
      "leaves rustled in the woods ever so mournful; and I heard an owl, away\n",
      "off, who-whooing about somebody that was dead, and a whippowill and a\n",
      "dog crying about somebody that was going to die; and the wind was trying\n",
      "to whisper something to me, and I couldn't make out what it was, and so\n",
      "it made the cold shivers run over me. Then away out in the woods I heard\n",
      "that kind of a sound that a ghost makes when it wants to tell about\n",
      "something that's on its mind and can't make itself understood, and so\n",
      "can't rest easy in its grave, and has to go about that way every night\n",
      "grieving.  I got so down-hearted and scared I did wish I had some\n",
      "company.  Pretty soon a spider went crawling up my shoulder, and I\n",
      "flipped it off and it lit in the candle; and before I could budge it\n",
      "was all shriveled up.  I didn't need anybody to tell me that that was\n",
      "an awful bad sign and would fetch me some bad luck, so I was scared\n",
      "and most shook the clothes off of me. I got up and turned around in my\n",
      "tracks three times and crossed my breast every time; and then I tied\n",
      "up a little lock of my hair with a thread to keep witches away.  But\n",
      "I hadn't no confidence.  You do that when you've lost a horseshoe that\n",
      "you've found, instead of nailing it up over the door, but I hadn't ever\n",
      "heard anybody say it was any way to keep off bad luck when you'd killed\n",
      "a spider.\n",
      "\n",
      "I set down again, a-shaking all over, and got out my pipe for a smoke;\n",
      "for the house was all as still as death now, and so the widow wouldn't\n",
      "know. Well, after a long time I heard the clock away off in the town\n",
      "go boom--boom--boom--twelve licks; and all still again--stiller than\n",
      "ever. Pretty soon I heard a twig snap down in the dark amongst the\n",
      "trees--something was a stirring.  I set still and listened.  Directly I\n",
      "could just barely hear a \"me-yow! me-yow!\" down there.  That was good!\n",
      " Says I, \"me-yow! me-yow!\" as soft as I could, and then I put out the\n",
      "light and scrambled out of the window on to the shed.  Then I slipped\n",
      "down to the ground and crawled in among the trees, and, sure enough,\n",
      "there was Tom Sawyer waiting for me.\n",

      "CHAPTER II.\n",
      "\n",
      "WE went tiptoeing along a path amongst the trees back towards the end of\n",
      "the widow's garden, stooping down so as the branches wouldn't scrape our\n",
      "heads. When we was passing by the kitchen I fell over a root and made\n",
      "a noise.  We scrouched down and laid still.  Miss Watson's big nigger,\n",
      "named Jim, was setting in the kitchen door; we could see him pretty\n",
      "clear, because there was a light behind him.  He got up and stretched\n",
      "his neck out about a minute, listening.  Then he says:\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Who dah?\"\n",
      "\n",
      "He listened some more; then he come tiptoeing down and stood right\n",
      "between us; we could a touched him, nearly.  Well, likely it was\n",
      "minutes and minutes that there warn't a sound, and we all there so close\n",
      "together.  There was a place on my ankle that got to itching, but I\n",
      "dasn't scratch it; and then my ear begun to itch; and next my back,\n",
      "right between my shoulders.  Seemed like I'd die if I couldn't scratch.\n",
      " Well, I've noticed that thing plenty times since.  If you are with\n",
      "the quality, or at a funeral, or trying to go to sleep when you ain't\n",
      "sleepy--if you are anywheres where it won't do for you to scratch, why\n",
      "you will itch all over in upwards of a thousand places. Pretty soon Jim\n",
      "says:\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Say, who is you?  Whar is you?  Dog my cats ef I didn' hear sumf'n.\n",
      "Well, I know what I's gwyne to do:  I's gwyne to set down here and\n",
      "listen tell I hears it agin.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "So he set down on the ground betwixt me and Tom.  He leaned his back up\n",
      "against a tree, and stretched his legs out till one of them most touched\n",
      "one of mine.  My nose begun to itch.  It itched till the tears come into\n",
      "my eyes.  But I dasn't scratch.  Then it begun to itch on the inside.\n",
      "Next I got to itching underneath.  I didn't know how I was going to set\n",
      "still. This miserableness went on as much as six or seven minutes; but\n",
      "it seemed a sight longer than that.  I was itching in eleven different\n",
      "places now.  I reckoned I couldn't stand it more'n a minute longer,\n",
      "but I set my teeth hard and got ready to try.  Just then Jim begun\n",
      "to breathe heavy; next he begun to snore--and then I was pretty soon\n",
      "comfortable again.\n",
      "\n",
      "Tom he made a sign to me--kind of a little noise with his mouth--and we\n",
      "went creeping away on our hands and knees.  When we was ten foot off Tom\n",
      "whispered to me, and wanted to tie Jim to the tree for fun.  But I said\n",
      "no; he might wake and make a disturbance, and then they'd find out I\n",
      "warn't in. Then Tom said he hadn't got candles enough, and he would slip\n",
      "in the kitchen and get some more.  I didn't want him to try.  I said Jim\n",
      "might wake up and come.  But Tom wanted to resk it; so we slid in there\n",
      "and got three candles, and Tom laid five cents on the table for pay.\n",
      "Then we got out, and I was in a sweat to get away; but nothing would do\n",
      "Tom but he must crawl to where Jim was, on his hands and knees, and play\n",
      "something on him.  I waited, and it seemed a good while, everything was\n",
      "so still and lonesome.\n",
      "\n",
      "As soon as Tom was back we cut along the path, around the garden fence,\n",
      "and by and by fetched up on the steep top of the hill the other side of\n",
      "the house.  Tom said he slipped Jim's hat off of his head and hung it\n",
      "on a limb right over him, and Jim stirred a little, but he didn't wake.\n",
      "Afterwards Jim said the witches be witched him and put him in a trance,\n",
      "and rode him all over the State, and then set him under the trees again,\n",
      "and hung his hat on a limb to show who done it.  And next time Jim told\n",
      "it he said they rode him down to New Orleans; and, after that, every\n",
      "time he told it he spread it more and more, till by and by he said they\n",
      "rode him all over the world, and tired him most to death, and his back\n",
      "was all over saddle-boils.  Jim was monstrous proud about it, and he\n",
      "got so he wouldn't hardly notice the other niggers.  Niggers would come\n",
      "miles to hear Jim tell about it, and he was more looked up to than any\n",
      "nigger in that country.  Strange niggers would stand with their mouths\n",
      "open and look him all over, same as if he was a wonder.  Niggers is\n",
      "always talking about witches in the dark by the kitchen fire; but\n",
      "whenever one was talking and letting on to know all about such things,\n",
      "Jim would happen in and say, \"Hm!  What you know 'bout witches?\" and\n",
      "that nigger was corked up and had to take a back seat.  Jim always kept\n",
      "that five-center piece round his neck with a string, and said it was a\n",
      "charm the devil give to him with his own hands, and told him he could\n",
      "cure anybody with it and fetch witches whenever he wanted to just by\n",
      "saying something to it; but he never told what it was he said to it.\n",
      " Niggers would come from all around there and give Jim anything they\n",
      "had, just for a sight of that five-center piece; but they wouldn't touch\n",
      "it, because the devil had had his hands on it.  Jim was most ruined for\n",
      "a servant, because he got stuck up on account of having seen the devil\n",
      "and been rode by witches.\n",
      "\n",
      "Well, when Tom and me got to the edge of the hilltop we looked away down\n",
      "into the village and could see three or four lights twinkling, where\n",
      "there was sick folks, maybe; and the stars over us was sparkling ever\n",
      "so fine; and down by the village was the river, a whole mile broad, and\n",
      "awful still and grand.  We went down the hill and found Jo Harper and\n",
      "Ben Rogers, and two or three more of the boys, hid in the old tanyard.\n",
      " So we unhitched a skiff and pulled down the river two mile and a half,\n",
      "to the big scar on the hillside, and went ashore.\n",
      "\n",
      "We went to a clump of bushes, and Tom made everybody swear to keep the\n",
      "secret, and then showed them a hole in the hill, right in the thickest\n",
      "part of the bushes.  Then we lit the candles, and crawled in on our\n",
      "hands and knees.  We went about two hundred yards, and then the cave\n",
      "opened up. Tom poked about amongst the passages, and pretty soon ducked\n",
      "under a wall where you wouldn't a noticed that there was a hole.  We\n",
      "went along a narrow place and got into a kind of room, all damp and\n",
      "sweaty and cold, and there we stopped.  Tom says:\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Now, we'll start this band of robbers and call it Tom Sawyer's Gang.\n",
      "Everybody that wants to join has got to take an oath, and write his name\n",
      "in blood.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "Everybody was willing.  So Tom got out a sheet of paper that he had\n",
      "wrote the oath on, and read it.  It swore every boy to stick to the\n",
      "band, and never tell any of the secrets; and if anybody done anything to\n",
      "any boy in the band, whichever boy was ordered to kill that person and\n",
      "his family must do it, and he mustn't eat and he mustn't sleep till he\n",
      "had killed them and hacked a cross in their breasts, which was the sign\n",
      "of the band. And nobody that didn't belong to the band could use that\n",
      "mark, and if he did he must be sued; and if he done it again he must be\n",
      "killed.  And if anybody that belonged to the band told the secrets, he\n",
      "must have his throat cut, and then have his carcass burnt up and the\n",
      "ashes scattered all around, and his name blotted off of the list with\n",
      "blood and never mentioned again by the gang, but have a curse put on it\n",
      "and be forgot forever.\n",
      "\n",
      "Everybody said it was a real beautiful oath, and asked Tom if he got\n",
      "it out of his own head.  He said, some of it, but the rest was out of\n",
      "pirate-books and robber-books, and every gang that was high-toned had\n",
      "it.\n",
      "\n",
      "Some thought it would be good to kill the _families_ of boys that told\n",
      "the secrets.  Tom said it was a good idea, so he took a pencil and wrote\n",
      "it in. Then Ben Rogers says:\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Here's Huck Finn, he hain't got no family; what you going to do 'bout\n",
      "him?\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Well, hain't he got a father?\" says Tom Sawyer.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Yes, he's got a father, but you can't never find him these days.  He\n",
      "used to lay drunk with the hogs in the tanyard, but he hain't been seen\n",
      "in these parts for a year or more.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "They talked it over, and they was going to rule me out, because they\n",
      "said every boy must have a family or somebody to kill, or else it\n",
      "wouldn't be fair and square for the others.  Well, nobody could think of\n",
      "anything to do--everybody was stumped, and set still.  I was most ready\n",
      "to cry; but all at once I thought of a way, and so I offered them Miss\n",
      "Watson--they could kill her.  Everybody said:\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Oh, she'll do.  That's all right.  Huck can come in.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "Then they all stuck a pin in their fingers to get blood to sign with,\n",
      "and I made my mark on the paper.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Now,\" says Ben Rogers, \"what's the line of business of this Gang?\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Nothing only robbery and murder,\" Tom said.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"But who are we going to rob?--houses, or cattle, or--\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Stuff! stealing cattle and such things ain't robbery; it's burglary,\"\n",
      "says Tom Sawyer.  \"We ain't burglars.  That ain't no sort of style.  We\n",
      "are highwaymen.  We stop stages and carriages on the road, with masks\n",
      "on, and kill the people and take their watches and money.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Must we always kill the people?\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Oh, certainly.  It's best.  Some authorities think different, but\n",
      "mostly it's considered best to kill them--except some that you bring to\n",
      "the cave here, and keep them till they're ransomed.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Ransomed?  What's that?\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"I don't know.  But that's what they do.  I've seen it in books; and so\n",
      "of course that's what we've got to do.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"But how can we do it if we don't know what it is?\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Why, blame it all, we've _got_ to do it.  Don't I tell you it's in the\n",
      "books?  Do you want to go to doing different from what's in the books,\n",
      "and get things all muddled up?\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Oh, that's all very fine to _say_, Tom Sawyer, but how in the nation\n",
      "are these fellows going to be ransomed if we don't know how to do it\n",
      "to them?--that's the thing I want to get at.  Now, what do you reckon it\n",
      "is?\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Well, I don't know.  But per'aps if we keep them till they're ransomed,\n",
      "it means that we keep them till they're dead.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Now, that's something _like_.  That'll answer.  Why couldn't you said\n",
      "that before?  We'll keep them till they're ransomed to death; and a\n",
      "bothersome lot they'll be, too--eating up everything, and always trying\n",
      "to get loose.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"How you talk, Ben Rogers.  How can they get loose when there's a guard\n",
      "over them, ready to shoot them down if they move a peg?\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"A guard!  Well, that _is_ good.  So somebody's got to set up all night\n",
      "and never get any sleep, just so as to watch them.  I think that's\n",
      "foolishness. Why can't a body take a club and ransom them as soon as\n",

      "would take it, because maybe it wouldn't know the difference.  Jim smelt\n",
      "it and bit it and rubbed it, and said he would manage so the hair-ball\n",

      "seemed terrible still.  He was laying over by the corner. By and by he\n",

      "alone, and he rolled himself up in his blanket and wallowed in under the\n",

      "there'd be somebody laying down in it, because people often done that\n",
      "to fool folks, and when a chap had pulled a skiff out most to it they'd\n",
      "raise up and laugh at him.  But it warn't so this time.  It was a\n",

      "\n",

      "rise. By and by along comes part of a log raft--nine logs fast together.\n",
      " We went out with the skiff and towed it ashore.  Then we had dinner.\n",
      "Anybody but pap would a waited and seen the day through, so as to catch\n",
      "more stuff; but that warn't pap's style.  Nine logs was enough for one\n",
      "time; he must shove right over to town and sell.  So he locked me in and\n",
      "took the skiff, and started off towing the raft about half-past three.\n",
      " I judged he wouldn't come back that night.  I waited till I reckoned he\n",

      "\n",
      "I took the sack of corn meal and took it to where the canoe was hid, and\n",
      "shoved the vines and branches apart and put it in; then I done the same\n",
      "with the side of bacon; then the whisky-jug.  I took all the coffee and\n",
      "sugar there was, and all the ammunition; I took the wadding; I took the\n",
      "bucket and gourd; I took a dipper and a tin cup, and my old saw and two\n",
      "blankets, and the skillet and the coffee-pot.  I took fish-lines and\n",
      "matches and other things--everything that was worth a cent.  I cleaned\n",
      "out the place.  I wanted an axe, but there wasn't any, only the one out\n",
      "at the woodpile, and I knowed why I was going to leave that.  I fetched\n",
      "out the gun, and now I was done.\n",
      "\n",
      "I had wore the ground a good deal crawling out of the hole and dragging\n",
      "out so many things.  So I fixed that as good as I could from the outside\n",
      "by scattering dust on the place, which covered up the smoothness and the\n",
      "sawdust.  Then I fixed the piece of log back into its place, and put two\n",
      "rocks under it and one against it to hold it there, for it was bent up\n",
      "at that place and didn't quite touch ground.  If you stood four or five\n",
      "foot away and didn't know it was sawed, you wouldn't never notice\n",
      "it; and besides, this was the back of the cabin, and it warn't likely\n",
      "anybody would go fooling around there.\n",
      "\n",
      "It was all grass clear to the canoe, so I hadn't left a track.  I\n",
      "followed around to see.  I stood on the bank and looked out over the\n",
      "river.  All safe.  So I took the gun and went up a piece into the woods,\n",
      "and was hunting around for some birds when I see a wild pig; hogs soon\n",
      "went wild in them bottoms after they had got away from the prairie\n",
      "farms. I shot this fellow and took him into camp.\n",
      "\n",
      "I took the axe and smashed in the door.  I beat it and hacked it\n",
      "considerable a-doing it.  I fetched the pig in, and took him back nearly\n",
      "to the table and hacked into his throat with the axe, and laid him down\n",
      "on the ground to bleed; I say ground because it was ground--hard packed,\n",
      "and no boards.  Well, next I took an old sack and put a lot of big rocks\n",
      "in it--all I could drag--and I started it from the pig, and dragged it to\n",
      "the door and through the woods down to the river and dumped it in, and\n",
      "down it sunk, out of sight.  You could easy see that something had been\n",
      "dragged over the ground.  I did wish Tom Sawyer was there; I knowed he\n",
      "would take an interest in this kind of business, and throw in the fancy\n",
      "touches.  Nobody could spread himself like Tom Sawyer in such a thing as\n",
      "that.\n",
      "\n",
      "Well, last I pulled out some of my hair, and blooded the axe good, and\n",
      "stuck it on the back side, and slung the axe in the corner.  Then I\n",
      "took up the pig and held him to my breast with my jacket (so he couldn't\n",
      "drip) till I got a good piece below the house and then dumped him into\n",
      "the river.  Now I thought of something else.  So I went and got the bag\n",
      "of meal and my old saw out of the canoe, and fetched them to the house.\n",
      " I took the bag to where it used to stand, and ripped a hole in the\n",
      "bottom of it with the saw, for there warn't no knives and forks on the\n",
      "place--pap done everything with his clasp-knife about the cooking.  Then\n",
      "I carried the sack about a hundred yards across the grass and through\n",
      "the willows east of the house, to a shallow lake that was five mile wide\n",
      "and full of rushes--and ducks too, you might say, in the season.  There\n",
      "was a slough or a creek leading out of it on the other side that went\n",
      "miles away, I don't know where, but it didn't go to the river.  The meal\n",
      "sifted out and made a little track all the way to the lake.  I dropped\n",
      "pap's whetstone there too, so as to look like it had been done by\n",
      "accident. Then I tied up the rip in the meal sack with a string, so it\n",
      "wouldn't leak no more, and took it and my saw to the canoe again.\n",
      "\n",
      "It was about dark now; so I dropped the canoe down the river under some\n",
      "willows that hung over the bank, and waited for the moon to rise.  I\n",
      "made fast to a willow; then I took a bite to eat, and by and by laid\n",
      "down in the canoe to smoke a pipe and lay out a plan.  I says to myself,\n",
      "they'll follow the track of that sackful of rocks to the shore and then\n",
      "drag the river for me.  And they'll follow that meal track to the lake\n",
      "and go browsing down the creek that leads out of it to find the robbers\n",
      "that killed me and took the things.  They won't ever hunt the river for\n",
      "anything but my dead carcass. They'll soon get tired of that, and won't\n",
      "bother no more about me.  All right; I can stop anywhere I want to.\n",
      "Jackson's Island is good enough for me; I know that island pretty well,\n",
      "and nobody ever comes there.  And then I can paddle over to town nights,\n",
      "and slink around and pick up things I want. Jackson's Island's the\n",
      "place.\n",
      "\n",
      "I was pretty tired, and the first thing I knowed I was asleep.  When\n",
      "I woke up I didn't know where I was for a minute.  I set up and looked\n",
      "around, a little scared.  Then I remembered.  The river looked miles and\n",
      "miles across.  The moon was so bright I could a counted the drift logs\n",
      "that went a-slipping along, black and still, hundreds of yards out from\n",
      "shore. Everything was dead quiet, and it looked late, and _smelt_ late.\n",
      "You know what I mean--I don't know the words to put it in.\n",
      "\n",
      "I took a good gap and a stretch, and was just going to unhitch and start\n",
      "when I heard a sound away over the water.  I listened.  Pretty soon I\n",
      "made it out.  It was that dull kind of a regular sound that comes from\n",
      "oars working in rowlocks when it's a still night.  I peeped out through\n",
      "the willow branches, and there it was--a skiff, away across the water.\n",
      " I couldn't tell how many was in it.  It kept a-coming, and when it was\n",
      "abreast of me I see there warn't but one man in it.  Think's I, maybe\n",
      "it's pap, though I warn't expecting him.  He dropped below me with the\n",
      "current, and by and by he came a-swinging up shore in the easy water,\n",
      "and he went by so close I could a reached out the gun and touched him.\n",
      " Well, it _was_ pap, sure enough--and sober, too, by the way he laid his\n",
      "oars.\n",
      "\n",
      "I didn't lose no time.  The next minute I was a-spinning down stream\n",
      "soft but quick in the shade of the bank.  I made two mile and a half,\n",
      "and then struck out a quarter of a mile or more towards the middle of\n",
      "the river, because pretty soon I would be passing the ferry landing, and\n",
      "people might see me and hail me.  I got out amongst the driftwood, and\n",
      "then laid down in the bottom of the canoe and let her float.\n",
      "\n",
      " I laid there, and had a good rest and a smoke out of my pipe, looking\n",
      "away into the sky; not a cloud in it.  The sky looks ever so deep when\n",
      "you lay down on your back in the moonshine; I never knowed it before.\n",
      " And how far a body can hear on the water such nights!  I heard people\n",
      "talking at the ferry landing. I heard what they said, too--every word\n",
      "of it.  One man said it was getting towards the long days and the short\n",
      "nights now.  T'other one said _this_ warn't one of the short ones, he\n",
      "reckoned--and then they laughed, and he said it over again, and they\n",
      "laughed again; then they waked up another fellow and told him, and\n",
      "laughed, but he didn't laugh; he ripped out something brisk, and said\n",
      "let him alone.  The first fellow said he 'lowed to tell it to his\n",
      "old woman--she would think it was pretty good; but he said that warn't\n",
      "nothing to some things he had said in his time. I heard one man say it\n",
      "was nearly three o'clock, and he hoped daylight wouldn't wait more than\n",
      "about a week longer.  After that the talk got further and further away,\n",
      "and I couldn't make out the words any more; but I could hear the mumble,\n",
      "and now and then a laugh, too, but it seemed a long ways off.\n",
      "\n",
      "I was away below the ferry now.  I rose up, and there was Jackson's\n",
      "Island, about two mile and a half down stream, heavy timbered and\n",
      "standing up out of the middle of the river, big and dark and solid, like\n",
      "a steamboat without any lights.  There warn't any signs of the bar at\n",
      "the head--it was all under water now.\n",
      "\n",
      "It didn't take me long to get there.  I shot past the head at a ripping\n",
      "rate, the current was so swift, and then I got into the dead water and\n",
      "landed on the side towards the Illinois shore.  I run the canoe into\n",
      "a deep dent in the bank that I knowed about; I had to part the willow\n",
      "branches to get in; and when I made fast nobody could a seen the canoe\n",
      "from the outside.\n",
      "\n",
      "I went up and set down on a log at the head of the island, and looked\n",
      "out on the big river and the black driftwood and away over to the town,\n",
      "three mile away, where there was three or four lights twinkling.  A\n",
      "monstrous big lumber-raft was about a mile up stream, coming along down,\n",
      "with a lantern in the middle of it.  I watched it come creeping down,\n",

      "oars, there! heave her head to stabboard!\"  I heard that just as plain\n",
      "as if the man was by my side.\n",
      "\n",
      "There was a little gray in the sky now; so I stepped into the woods, and\n",

      "CHAPTER VIII.\n",
      "\n",
      "THE sun was up so high when I waked that I judged it was after eight\n",
      "o'clock.  I laid there in the grass and the cool shade thinking about\n",
      "things, and feeling rested and ruther comfortable and satisfied.  I\n",
      "could see the sun out at one or two holes, but mostly it was big trees\n",
      "all about, and gloomy in there amongst them.  There was freckled places\n",
      "on the ground where the light sifted down through the leaves, and the\n",
      "freckled places swapped about a little, showing there was a little\n",
      "breeze up there.  A couple of squirrels set on a limb and jabbered at me\n",
      "very friendly.\n",
      "\n",
      "I was powerful lazy and comfortable--didn't want to get up and cook\n",
      "breakfast.  Well, I was dozing off again when I thinks I hears a deep\n",
      "sound of \"boom!\" away up the river.  I rouses up, and rests on my elbow\n",
      "and listens; pretty soon I hears it again.  I hopped up, and went and\n",
      "looked out at a hole in the leaves, and I see a bunch of smoke laying\n",
      "on the water a long ways up--about abreast the ferry.  And there was the\n",
      "ferryboat full of people floating along down.  I knowed what was the\n",
      "matter now.  \"Boom!\" I see the white smoke squirt out of the ferryboat's\n",
      "side.  You see, they was firing cannon over the water, trying to make my\n",
      "carcass come to the top.\n",
      "\n",
      "I was pretty hungry, but it warn't going to do for me to start a fire,\n",
      "because they might see the smoke.  So I set there and watched the\n",
      "cannon-smoke and listened to the boom.  The river was a mile wide there,\n",
      "and it always looks pretty on a summer morning--so I was having a good\n",
      "enough time seeing them hunt for my remainders if I only had a bite to\n",
      "eat. Well, then I happened to think how they always put quicksilver in\n",
      "loaves of bread and float them off, because they always go right to the\n",
      "drownded carcass and stop there.  So, says I, I'll keep a lookout, and\n",
      "if any of them's floating around after me I'll give them a show.  I\n",
      "changed to the Illinois edge of the island to see what luck I could\n",
      "have, and I warn't disappointed.  A big double loaf come along, and I\n",
      "most got it with a long stick, but my foot slipped and she floated out\n",
      "further.  Of course I was where the current set in the closest to the\n",
      "shore--I knowed enough for that.  But by and by along comes another one,\n",
      "and this time I won.  I took out the plug and shook out the little dab\n",
      "of quicksilver, and set my teeth in.  It was \"baker's bread\"--what the\n",
      "quality eat; none of your low-down corn-pone.\n",
      "\n",
      "I got a good place amongst the leaves, and set there on a log, munching\n",
      "the bread and watching the ferry-boat, and very well satisfied.  And\n",
      "then something struck me.  I says, now I reckon the widow or the parson\n",
      "or somebody prayed that this bread would find me, and here it has gone\n",
      "and done it.  So there ain't no doubt but there is something in that\n",
      "thing--that is, there's something in it when a body like the widow or the\n",
      "parson prays, but it don't work for me, and I reckon it don't work for\n",
      "only just the right kind.\n",
      "\n",
      "I lit a pipe and had a good long smoke, and went on watching.  The\n",
      "ferryboat was floating with the current, and I allowed I'd have a chance\n",
      "to see who was aboard when she come along, because she would come in\n",
      "close, where the bread did.  When she'd got pretty well along down\n",
      "towards me, I put out my pipe and went to where I fished out the bread,\n",
      "and laid down behind a log on the bank in a little open place.  Where\n",
      "the log forked I could peep through.\n",
      "\n",
      "By and by she come along, and she drifted in so close that they could\n",
      "a run out a plank and walked ashore.  Most everybody was on the boat.\n",
      " Pap, and Judge Thatcher, and Bessie Thatcher, and Jo Harper, and Tom\n",
      "Sawyer, and his old Aunt Polly, and Sid and Mary, and plenty more.\n",
      " Everybody was talking about the murder, but the captain broke in and\n",
      "says:\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Look sharp, now; the current sets in the closest here, and maybe he's\n",
      "washed ashore and got tangled amongst the brush at the water's edge.  I\n",
      "hope so, anyway.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "I didn't hope so.  They all crowded up and leaned over the rails, nearly\n",
      "in my face, and kept still, watching with all their might.  I could see\n",
      "them first-rate, but they couldn't see me.  Then the captain sung out:\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Stand away!\" and the cannon let off such a blast right before me that\n",
      "it made me deef with the noise and pretty near blind with the smoke, and\n",
      "I judged I was gone.  If they'd a had some bullets in, I reckon they'd\n",
      "a got the corpse they was after.  Well, I see I warn't hurt, thanks to\n",
      "goodness. The boat floated on and went out of sight around the shoulder\n",
      "of the island.  I could hear the booming now and then, further and\n",
      "further off, and by and by, after an hour, I didn't hear it no more.\n",
      " The island was three mile long.  I judged they had got to the foot, and\n",
      "was giving it up.  But they didn't yet a while.  They turned around\n",
      "the foot of the island and started up the channel on the Missouri side,\n",
      "under steam, and booming once in a while as they went.  I crossed over\n",
      "to that side and watched them. When they got abreast the head of the\n",
      "island they quit shooting and dropped over to the Missouri shore and\n",
      "went home to the town.\n",
      "\n",
      "I knowed I was all right now.  Nobody else would come a-hunting after\n",
      "me. I got my traps out of the canoe and made me a nice camp in the thick\n",
      "woods.  I made a kind of a tent out of my blankets to put my things\n",
      "under so the rain couldn't get at them.  I catched a catfish and haggled\n",
      "him open with my saw, and towards sundown I started my camp fire and had\n",
      "supper.  Then I set out a line to catch some fish for breakfast.\n",
      "\n",
      "When it was dark I set by my camp fire smoking, and feeling pretty well\n",
      "satisfied; but by and by it got sort of lonesome, and so I went and set\n",
      "on the bank and listened to the current swashing along, and counted the\n",
      "stars and drift logs and rafts that come down, and then went to bed;\n",
      "there ain't no better way to put in time when you are lonesome; you\n",
      "can't stay so, you soon get over it.\n",
      "\n",
      "And so for three days and nights.  No difference--just the same thing.\n",
      "But the next day I went exploring around down through the island.  I was\n",
      "boss of it; it all belonged to me, so to say, and I wanted to know\n",
      "all about it; but mainly I wanted to put in the time.  I found plenty\n",
      "strawberries, ripe and prime; and green summer grapes, and green\n",
      "razberries; and the green blackberries was just beginning to show.  They\n",
      "would all come handy by and by, I judged.\n",
      "\n",
      "Well, I went fooling along in the deep woods till I judged I warn't\n",
      "far from the foot of the island.  I had my gun along, but I hadn't shot\n",
      "nothing; it was for protection; thought I would kill some game nigh\n",
      "home. About this time I mighty near stepped on a good-sized snake,\n",
      "and it went sliding off through the grass and flowers, and I after\n",
      "it, trying to get a shot at it. I clipped along, and all of a sudden I\n",
      "bounded right on to the ashes of a camp fire that was still smoking.\n",
      "\n",
      "My heart jumped up amongst my lungs.  I never waited for to look\n",
      "further, but uncocked my gun and went sneaking back on my tiptoes as\n",
      "fast as ever I could.  Every now and then I stopped a second amongst the\n",
      "thick leaves and listened, but my breath come so hard I couldn't hear\n",
      "nothing else.  I slunk along another piece further, then listened again;\n",
      "and so on, and so on.  If I see a stump, I took it for a man; if I trod\n",
      "on a stick and broke it, it made me feel like a person had cut one of my\n",
      "breaths in two and I only got half, and the short half, too.\n",
      "\n",
      "When I got to camp I warn't feeling very brash, there warn't much sand\n",
      "in my craw; but I says, this ain't no time to be fooling around.  So I\n",
      "got all my traps into my canoe again so as to have them out of sight,\n",
      "and I put out the fire and scattered the ashes around to look like an\n",
      "old last year's camp, and then clumb a tree.\n",
      "\n",
      "I reckon I was up in the tree two hours; but I didn't see nothing,\n",
      "I didn't hear nothing--I only _thought_ I heard and seen as much as a\n",
      "thousand things.  Well, I couldn't stay up there forever; so at last I\n",
      "got down, but I kept in the thick woods and on the lookout all the\n",
      "time. All I could get to eat was berries and what was left over from\n",
      "breakfast.\n",
      "\n",
      "By the time it was night I was pretty hungry.  So when it was good\n",
      "and dark I slid out from shore before moonrise and paddled over to the\n",
      "Illinois bank--about a quarter of a mile.  I went out in the woods and\n",
      "cooked a supper, and I had about made up my mind I would stay there\n",
      "all night when I hear a _plunkety-plunk, plunkety-plunk_, and says\n",
      "to myself, horses coming; and next I hear people's voices.  I got\n",
      "everything into the canoe as quick as I could, and then went creeping\n",
      "through the woods to see what I could find out.  I hadn't got far when I\n",
      "hear a man say:\n",
      "\n",
      "\"We better camp here if we can find a good place; the horses is about\n",
      "beat out.  Let's look around.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "I didn't wait, but shoved out and paddled away easy.  I tied up in the\n",
      "old place, and reckoned I would sleep in the canoe.\n",
      "\n",
      "I didn't sleep much.  I couldn't, somehow, for thinking.  And every time\n",
      "I waked up I thought somebody had me by the neck.  So the sleep didn't\n",
      "do me no good.  By and by I says to myself, I can't live this way; I'm\n",
      "a-going to find out who it is that's here on the island with me; I'll\n",
      "find it out or bust.  Well, I felt better right off.\n",
      "\n",
      "So I took my paddle and slid out from shore just a step or two, and\n",
      "then let the canoe drop along down amongst the shadows.  The moon was\n",
      "shining, and outside of the shadows it made it most as light as day.\n",
      " I poked along well on to an hour, everything still as rocks and sound\n",
      "asleep. Well, by this time I was most down to the foot of the island.  A\n",
      "little ripply, cool breeze begun to blow, and that was as good as saying\n",
      "the night was about done.  I give her a turn with the paddle and brung\n",
      "her nose to shore; then I got my gun and slipped out and into the edge\n",
      "of the woods.  I sat down there on a log, and looked out through the\n",
      "leaves.  I see the moon go off watch, and the darkness begin to blanket\n",
      "the river. But in a little while I see a pale streak over the treetops,\n",
      "and knowed the day was coming.  So I took my gun and slipped off towards\n",
      "where I had run across that camp fire, stopping every minute or two\n",
      "to listen.  But I hadn't no luck somehow; I couldn't seem to find the\n",
      "place.  But by and by, sure enough, I catched a glimpse of fire away\n",
      "through the trees.  I went for it, cautious and slow.  By and by I was\n",
      "close enough to have a look, and there laid a man on the ground.  It\n",
      "most give me the fan-tods. He had a blanket around his head, and his\n",
      "head was nearly in the fire.  I set there behind a clump of bushes, in\n",
      "about six foot of him, and kept my eyes on him steady.  It was getting\n",
      "gray daylight now.  Pretty soon he gapped and stretched himself and hove\n",
      "off the blanket, and it was Miss Watson's Jim!  I bet I was glad to see\n",
      "him.  I says:\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Hello, Jim!\" and skipped out.\n",
      "\n",
      "He bounced up and stared at me wild.  Then he drops down on his knees,\n",
      "and puts his hands together and says:\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Doan' hurt me--don't!  I hain't ever done no harm to a ghos'.  I alwuz\n",
      "liked dead people, en done all I could for 'em.  You go en git in de\n",
      "river agin, whah you b'longs, en doan' do nuffn to Ole Jim, 'at 'uz\n",
      "awluz yo' fren'.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "Well, I warn't long making him understand I warn't dead.  I was ever so\n",
      "glad to see Jim.  I warn't lonesome now.  I told him I warn't afraid of\n",
      "_him_ telling the people where I was.  I talked along, but he only set\n",
      "there and looked at me; never said nothing.  Then I says:\n",
      "\n",
      "\"It's good daylight.  Le's get breakfast.  Make up your camp fire good.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"What's de use er makin' up de camp fire to cook strawbries en sich\n",
      "truck? But you got a gun, hain't you?  Den we kin git sumfn better den\n",
      "strawbries.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Strawberries and such truck,\" I says.  \"Is that what you live on?\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"I couldn' git nuffn else,\" he says.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Why, how long you been on the island, Jim?\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"I come heah de night arter you's killed.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"What, all that time?\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Yes--indeedy.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"And ain't you had nothing but that kind of rubbage to eat?\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"No, sah--nuffn else.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Well, you must be most starved, ain't you?\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"I reck'n I could eat a hoss.  I think I could. How long you ben on de\n",
      "islan'?\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Since the night I got killed.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"No!  W'y, what has you lived on?  But you got a gun.  Oh, yes, you got\n",
      "a gun.  Dat's good.  Now you kill sumfn en I'll make up de fire.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "So we went over to where the canoe was, and while he built a fire in\n",
      "a grassy open place amongst the trees, I fetched meal and bacon and\n",
      "coffee, and coffee-pot and frying-pan, and sugar and tin cups, and the\n",
      "nigger was set back considerable, because he reckoned it was all done\n",
      "with witchcraft. I catched a good big catfish, too, and Jim cleaned him\n",
      "with his knife, and fried him.\n",
      "\n",
      "When breakfast was ready we lolled on the grass and eat it smoking hot.\n",
      "Jim laid it in with all his might, for he was most about starved.  Then\n",
      "when we had got pretty well stuffed, we laid off and lazied.  By and by\n",

      "I wanted to go and look at a place right about the middle of the island\n",
      "that I'd found when I was exploring; so we started and soon got to it,\n",
      "because the island was only three miles long and a quarter of a mile\n",
      "wide.\n",
      "\n",
      "This place was a tolerable long, steep hill or ridge about forty foot\n",
      "high. We had a rough time getting to the top, the sides was so steep and\n",
      "the bushes so thick.  We tramped and clumb around all over it, and by\n",
      "and by found a good big cavern in the rock, most up to the top on the\n",
      "side towards Illinois.  The cavern was as big as two or three rooms\n",
      "bunched together, and Jim could stand up straight in it.  It was cool in\n",
      "there. Jim was for putting our traps in there right away, but I said we\n",
      "didn't want to be climbing up and down there all the time.\n",
      "\n",
      "Jim said if we had the canoe hid in a good place, and had all the traps\n",
      "in the cavern, we could rush there if anybody was to come to the island,\n",
      "and they would never find us without dogs.  And, besides, he said them\n",
      "little birds had said it was going to rain, and did I want the things to\n",
      "get wet?\n",
      "\n",
      "So we went back and got the canoe, and paddled up abreast the cavern,\n",
      "and lugged all the traps up there.  Then we hunted up a place close by\n",
      "to hide the canoe in, amongst the thick willows.  We took some fish off\n",
      "of the lines and set them again, and begun to get ready for dinner.\n",
      "\n",
      "The door of the cavern was big enough to roll a hogshead in, and on one\n",
      "side of the door the floor stuck out a little bit, and was flat and a\n",
      "good place to build a fire on.  So we built it there and cooked dinner.\n",
      "\n",
      "We spread the blankets inside for a carpet, and eat our dinner in there.\n",
      "We put all the other things handy at the back of the cavern.  Pretty\n",
      "soon it darkened up, and begun to thunder and lighten; so the birds was\n",
      "right about it.  Directly it begun to rain, and it rained like all fury,\n",
      "too, and I never see the wind blow so.  It was one of these regular\n",
      "summer storms.  It would get so dark that it looked all blue-black\n",
      "outside, and lovely; and the rain would thrash along by so thick that\n",
      "the trees off a little ways looked dim and spider-webby; and here would\n",
      "come a blast of wind that would bend the trees down and turn up the\n",
      "pale underside of the leaves; and then a perfect ripper of a gust would\n",
      "follow along and set the branches to tossing their arms as if they\n",
      "was just wild; and next, when it was just about the bluest and\n",
      "blackest--_FST_! it was as bright as glory, and you'd have a little\n",
      "glimpse of tree-tops a-plunging about away off yonder in the storm,\n",
      "hundreds of yards further than you could see before; dark as sin again\n",
      "in a second, and now you'd hear the thunder let go with an awful crash,\n",
      "and then go rumbling, grumbling, tumbling, down the sky towards the\n",
      "under side of the world, like rolling empty barrels down stairs--where\n",

      "the island in the low places and on the Illinois bottom.  On that side\n",
      "it was a good many miles wide, but on the Missouri side it was the same\n",
      "old distance across--a half a mile--because the Missouri shore was just a\n",
      "wall of high bluffs.\n",
      "\n",
      "Daytimes we paddled all over the island in the canoe, It was mighty cool\n",
      "and shady in the deep woods, even if the sun was blazing outside.  We\n",
      "went winding in and out amongst the trees, and sometimes the vines hung\n",
      "so thick we had to back away and go some other way.  Well, on every old\n",
      "broken-down tree you could see rabbits and snakes and such things; and\n",
      "when the island had been overflowed a day or two they got so tame, on\n",
      "account of being hungry, that you could paddle right up and put your\n",
      "hand on them if you wanted to; but not the snakes and turtles--they would\n",
      "slide off in the water.  The ridge our cavern was in was full of them.\n",
      "We could a had pets enough if we'd wanted them.\n",
      "\n",
      "One night we catched a little section of a lumber raft--nice pine planks.\n",
      "It was twelve foot wide and about fifteen or sixteen foot long, and\n",
      "the top stood above water six or seven inches--a solid, level floor.  We\n",
      "could see saw-logs go by in the daylight sometimes, but we let them go;\n",
      "we didn't show ourselves in daylight.\n",
      "\n",
      "Another night when we was up at the head of the island, just before\n",
      "daylight, here comes a frame-house down, on the west side.  She was\n",
      "a two-story, and tilted over considerable.  We paddled out and got\n",
      "aboard--clumb in at an upstairs window.  But it was too dark to see yet,\n",
      "so we made the canoe fast and set in her to wait for daylight.\n",
      "\n",
      "The light begun to come before we got to the foot of the island.  Then\n",
      "we looked in at the window.  We could make out a bed, and a table, and\n",
      "two old chairs, and lots of things around about on the floor, and there\n",
      "was clothes hanging against the wall.  There was something laying on the\n",
      "floor in the far corner that looked like a man.  So Jim says:\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Hello, you!\"\n",
      "\n",
      "But it didn't budge.  So I hollered again, and then Jim says:\n",
      "\n",
      "\"De man ain't asleep--he's dead.  You hold still--I'll go en see.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "He went, and bent down and looked, and says:\n",

      "at his face--it's too gashly.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "I didn't look at him at all.  Jim throwed some old rags over him, but\n",
      "he needn't done it; I didn't want to see him.  There was heaps of old\n",
      "greasy cards scattered around over the floor, and old whisky bottles,\n",
      "and a couple of masks made out of black cloth; and all over the walls\n",
      "was the ignorantest kind of words and pictures made with charcoal.\n",
      " There was two old dirty calico dresses, and a sun-bonnet, and some\n",
      "women's underclothes hanging against the wall, and some men's clothing,\n",
      "too.  We put the lot into the canoe--it might come good.  There was a\n",
      "boy's old speckled straw hat on the floor; I took that, too.  And there\n",
      "was a bottle that had had milk in it, and it had a rag stopper for a\n",
      "baby to suck.  We would a took the bottle, but it was broke.  There was\n",
      "a seedy old chest, and an old hair trunk with the hinges broke.  They\n",
      "stood open, but there warn't nothing left in them that was any account.\n",

      "hurry, and warn't fixed so as to carry off most of their stuff.\n",
      "\n",
      "We got an old tin lantern, and a butcher-knife without any handle, and\n",
      "a bran-new Barlow knife worth two bits in any store, and a lot of tallow\n",
      "candles, and a tin candlestick, and a gourd, and a tin cup, and a ratty\n",
      "old bedquilt off the bed, and a reticule with needles and pins and\n",
      "beeswax and buttons and thread and all such truck in it, and a hatchet\n",
      "and some nails, and a fishline as thick as my little finger with some\n",
      "monstrous hooks on it, and a roll of buckskin, and a leather dog-collar,\n",
      "and a horseshoe, and some vials of medicine that didn't have no label\n",
      "on them; and just as we was leaving I found a tolerable good curry-comb,\n",
      "and Jim he found a ratty old fiddle-bow, and a wooden leg.  The straps\n",
      "was broke off of it, but, barring that, it was a good enough leg, though\n",
      "it was too long for me and not long enough for Jim, and we couldn't find\n",
      "the other one, though we hunted all around.\n",
      "\n",
      "And so, take it all around, we made a good haul.  When we was ready to\n",
      "shove off we was a quarter of a mile below the island, and it was pretty\n",
      "broad day; so I made Jim lay down in the canoe and cover up with the\n",
      "quilt, because if he set up people could tell he was a nigger a good\n",
      "ways off.  I paddled over to the Illinois shore, and drifted down most\n",

      "that handling a snake-skin was such awful bad luck that maybe we hadn't\n",
      "got to the end of it yet.  He said he druther see the new moon over his\n",
      "left shoulder as much as a thousand times than take up a snake-skin\n",
      "in his hand.  Well, I was getting to feel that way myself, though I've\n",
      "always reckoned that looking at the new moon over your left shoulder is\n",
      "one of the carelessest and foolishest things a body can do.  Old Hank\n",
      "Bunker done it once, and bragged about it; and in less than two years he\n",
      "got drunk and fell off of the shot-tower, and spread himself out so\n",
      "that he was just a kind of a layer, as you may say; and they slid him\n",

      "\n",
      "Well, the days went along, and the river went down between its banks\n",
      "again; and about the first thing we done was to bait one of the big\n",
      "hooks with a skinned rabbit and set it and catch a catfish that was\n",
      "as big as a man, being six foot two inches long, and weighed over two\n",
      "hundred pounds. We couldn't handle him, of course; he would a flung us\n",
      "into Illinois.  We just set there and watched him rip and tear around\n",
      "till he drownded.  We found a brass button in his stomach and a round\n",
      "ball, and lots of rubbage.  We split the ball open with the hatchet,\n",
      "and there was a spool in it.  Jim said he'd had it there a long time, to\n",
      "coat it over so and make a ball of it.  It was as big a fish as was ever\n",
      "catched in the Mississippi, I reckon.  Jim said he hadn't ever seen\n",
      "a bigger one.  He would a been worth a good deal over at the village.\n",
      " They peddle out such a fish as that by the pound in the market-house\n",
      "there; everybody buys some of him; his meat's as white as snow and makes\n",

      "Next morning I said it was getting slow and dull, and I wanted to get a\n",

      "find out what was going on.  Jim liked that notion; but he said I\n",
      "must go in the dark and look sharp.  Then he studied it over and said,\n",
      "couldn't I put on some of them old things and dress up like a girl?\n",
      " That was a good notion, too.  So we shortened up one of the calico\n",
      "gowns, and I turned up my trouser-legs to my knees and got into it.  Jim\n",
      "hitched it behind with the hooks, and it was a fair fit.  I put on the\n",
      "sun-bonnet and tied it under my chin, and then for a body to look in\n",
      "and see my face was like looking down a joint of stove-pipe.  Jim said\n",
      "nobody would know me, even in the daytime, hardly.  I practiced around\n",
      "all day to get the hang of the things, and by and by I could do pretty\n",
      "well in them, only Jim said I didn't walk like a girl; and he said\n",

      "tied up and started along the bank.  There was a light burning in a\n",
      "little shanty that hadn't been lived in for a long time, and I wondered\n",
      "who had took up quarters there.  I slipped up and peeped in at the\n",
      "window.  There was a woman about forty year old in there knitting by\n",
      "a candle that was on a pine table.  I didn't know her face; she was a\n",

      "now she says:\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Honey, I thought you said it was Sarah when you first come in?\"\n",

      "they had to live, and how the rats was as free as if they owned the\n",
      "place, and so forth and so on, and then I got easy again.  She was right\n",
      "about the rats. You'd see one stick his nose out of a hole in the corner\n",
      "every little while.  She said she had to have things handy to throw at\n",
      "them when she was alone, or they wouldn't give her no peace.  She showed\n",
      "me a bar of lead twisted up into a knot, and said she was a good shot\n",
      "with it generly, but she'd wrenched her arm a day or two ago, and didn't\n",
      "know whether she could throw true now.  But she watched for a chance,\n",
      "and directly banged away at a rat; but she missed him wide, and said\n",
      "\"Ouch!\" it hurt her arm so.  Then she told me to try for the next one.\n",
      " I wanted to be getting away before the old man got back, but of course\n",
      "I didn't let on.  I got the thing, and the first rat that showed his\n",
      "nose I let drive, and if he'd a stayed where he was he'd a been a\n",
      "tolerable sick rat.  She said that was first-rate, and she reckoned I\n",
      "would hive the next one.  She went and got the lump of lead and fetched\n",
      "it back, and brought along a hank of yarn which she wanted me to help\n",
      "her with.  I held up my two hands and she put the hank over them, and\n",
      "went on talking about her and her husband's matters.  But she broke off\n",

      "\"Keep your eye on the rats.  You better have the lead in your lap,\n",
      "handy.\"\n",

      "minute. Then she took off the hank and looked me straight in the face,\n",

      "mile back from the river, and he treated me so bad I couldn't stand it\n",
      "no longer; he went away to be gone a couple of days, and so I took my\n",
      "chance and stole some of his daughter's old clothes and cleared out, and\n",
      "I had been three nights coming the thirty miles.  I traveled nights,\n",
      "and hid daytimes and slept, and the bag of bread and meat I carried from\n",
      "home lasted me all the way, and I had a-plenty.  I said I believed my\n",
      "uncle Abner Moore would take care of me, and so that was why I struck\n",
      "out for this town of Goshen.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Goshen, child?  This ain't Goshen.  This is St. Petersburg.  Goshen's\n",

      "a good fire there on a high and dry spot.\n",
      "\n",
      "Then I jumped in the canoe and dug out for our place, a mile and a half\n",

      "worked for the next half an hour showed about how he was scared.  By\n",
      "that time everything we had in the world was on our raft, and she was\n",
      "ready to be shoved out from the willow cove where she was hid.  We\n",
      "put out the camp fire at the cavern the first thing, and didn't show a\n",
      "candle outside after that.\n",
      "\n",
      "I took the canoe out from the shore a little piece, and took a look;\n",
      "but if there was a boat around I couldn't see it, for stars and shadows\n",
      "ain't good to see by.  Then we got out the raft and slipped along down\n",

      "\n",
      "IT must a been close on to one o'clock when we got below the island at\n",
      "last, and the raft did seem to go mighty slow.  If a boat was to come\n",
      "along we was going to take to the canoe and break for the Illinois\n",
      "shore; and it was well a boat didn't come, for we hadn't ever thought to\n",
      "put the gun in the canoe, or a fishing-line, or anything to eat.  We\n",
      "was in ruther too much of a sweat to think of so many things.  It warn't\n",
      "good judgment to put _everything_ on the raft.\n",
      "\n",
      "If the men went to the island I just expect they found the camp fire I\n",
      "built, and watched it all night for Jim to come.  Anyways, they stayed\n",
      "away from us, and if my building the fire never fooled them it warn't no\n",
      "fault of mine.  I played it as low down on them as I could.\n",
      "\n",
      "When the first streak of day began to show we tied up to a towhead in a\n",
      "big bend on the Illinois side, and hacked off cottonwood branches with\n",
      "the hatchet, and covered up the raft with them so she looked like there\n",
      "had been a cave-in in the bank there.  A tow-head is a sandbar that has\n",
      "cottonwoods on it as thick as harrow-teeth.\n",
      "\n",
      "We had mountains on the Missouri shore and heavy timber on the Illinois\n",
      "side, and the channel was down the Missouri shore at that place, so we\n",
      "warn't afraid of anybody running across us.  We laid there all day,\n",
      "and watched the rafts and steamboats spin down the Missouri shore, and\n",
      "up-bound steamboats fight the big river in the middle.  I told Jim all\n",
      "about the time I had jabbering with that woman; and Jim said she was\n",
      "a smart one, and if she was to start after us herself she wouldn't set\n",
      "down and watch a camp fire--no, sir, she'd fetch a dog.  Well, then, I\n",
      "said, why couldn't she tell her husband to fetch a dog?  Jim said he\n",
      "bet she did think of it by the time the men was ready to start, and he\n",
      "believed they must a gone up-town to get a dog and so they lost all that\n",
      "time, or else we wouldn't be here on a towhead sixteen or seventeen mile\n",
      "below the village--no, indeedy, we would be in that same old town again.\n",
      " So I said I didn't care what was the reason they didn't get us as long\n",
      "as they didn't.\n",
      "\n",
      "When it was beginning to come on dark we poked our heads out of the\n",
      "cottonwood thicket, and looked up and down and across; nothing in sight;\n",
      "so Jim took up some of the top planks of the raft and built a snug\n",
      "wigwam to get under in blazing weather and rainy, and to keep the things\n",
      "dry. Jim made a floor for the wigwam, and raised it a foot or more above\n",
      "the level of the raft, so now the blankets and all the traps was out of\n",
      "reach of steamboat waves.  Right in the middle of the wigwam we made a\n",
      "layer of dirt about five or six inches deep with a frame around it for\n",
      "to hold it to its place; this was to build a fire on in sloppy weather\n",
      "or chilly; the wigwam would keep it from being seen.  We made an extra\n",
      "steering-oar, too, because one of the others might get broke on a snag\n",
      "or something. We fixed up a short forked stick to hang the old lantern\n",
      "on, because we must always light the lantern whenever we see a steamboat\n",
      "coming down-stream, to keep from getting run over; but we wouldn't have\n",
      "to light it for up-stream boats unless we see we was in what they call\n",
      "a \"crossing\"; for the river was pretty high yet, very low banks being\n",
      "still a little under water; so up-bound boats didn't always run the\n",
      "channel, but hunted easy water.\n",
      "\n",
      "This second night we run between seven and eight hours, with a current\n",
      "that was making over four mile an hour.  We catched fish and talked,\n",
      "and we took a swim now and then to keep off sleepiness.  It was kind of\n",
      "solemn, drifting down the big, still river, laying on our backs looking\n",
      "up at the stars, and we didn't ever feel like talking loud, and it\n",
      "warn't often that we laughed--only a little kind of a low chuckle.  We\n",
      "had mighty good weather as a general thing, and nothing ever happened to\n",
      "us at all--that night, nor the next, nor the next.\n",
      "\n",
      "Every night we passed towns, some of them away up on black hillsides,\n",
      "nothing but just a shiny bed of lights; not a house could you see.  The\n",
      "fifth night we passed St. Louis, and it was like the whole world lit up.\n",
      "In St. Petersburg they used to say there was twenty or thirty thousand\n",
      "people in St. Louis, but I never believed it till I see that wonderful\n",
      "spread of lights at two o'clock that still night.  There warn't a sound\n",
      "there; everybody was asleep.\n",
      "\n",
      "Every night now I used to slip ashore towards ten o'clock at some little\n",
      "village, and buy ten or fifteen cents' worth of meal or bacon or other\n",
      "stuff to eat; and sometimes I lifted a chicken that warn't roosting\n",
      "comfortable, and took him along.  Pap always said, take a chicken when\n",
      "you get a chance, because if you don't want him yourself you can easy\n",
      "find somebody that does, and a good deed ain't ever forgot.  I never see\n",
      "pap when he didn't want the chicken himself, but that is what he used to\n",
      "say, anyway.\n",
      "\n",
      "Mornings before daylight I slipped into cornfields and borrowed a\n",
      "watermelon, or a mushmelon, or a punkin, or some new corn, or things of\n",
      "that kind.  Pap always said it warn't no harm to borrow things if you\n",
      "was meaning to pay them back some time; but the widow said it warn't\n",
      "anything but a soft name for stealing, and no decent body would do it.\n",
      " Jim said he reckoned the widow was partly right and pap was partly\n",
      "right; so the best way would be for us to pick out two or three things\n",
      "from the list and say we wouldn't borrow them any more--then he reckoned\n",
      "it wouldn't be no harm to borrow the others.  So we talked it over all\n",
      "one night, drifting along down the river, trying to make up our minds\n",
      "whether to drop the watermelons, or the cantelopes, or the mushmelons,\n",
      "or what.  But towards daylight we got it all settled satisfactory, and\n",
      "concluded to drop crabapples and p'simmons.  We warn't feeling just\n",
      "right before that, but it was all comfortable now.  I was glad the way\n",
      "it come out, too, because crabapples ain't ever good, and the p'simmons\n",
      "wouldn't be ripe for two or three months yet.\n",
      "\n",
      "We shot a water-fowl now and then that got up too early in the morning\n",
      "or didn't go to bed early enough in the evening.  Take it all round, we\n",
      "lived pretty high.\n",
      "\n",
      "The fifth night below St. Louis we had a big storm after midnight, with\n",
      "a power of thunder and lightning, and the rain poured down in a solid\n",
      "sheet. We stayed in the wigwam and let the raft take care of itself.\n",
      "When the lightning glared out we could see a big straight river ahead,\n",
      "and high, rocky bluffs on both sides.  By and by says I, \"Hel-_lo_, Jim,\n",
      "looky yonder!\" It was a steamboat that had killed herself on a rock.\n",
      " We was drifting straight down for her.  The lightning showed her very\n",
      "distinct.  She was leaning over, with part of her upper deck above\n",
      "water, and you could see every little chimbly-guy clean and clear, and a\n",
      "chair by the big bell, with an old slouch hat hanging on the back of it,\n",
      "when the flashes come.\n",
      "\n",
      "Well, it being away in the night and stormy, and all so mysterious-like,\n",
      "I felt just the way any other boy would a felt when I see that wreck\n",
      "laying there so mournful and lonesome in the middle of the river.  I\n",
      "wanted to get aboard of her and slink around a little, and see what\n",
      "there was there.  So I says:\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Le's land on her, Jim.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "But Jim was dead against it at first.  He says:\n",
      "\n",
      "\"I doan' want to go fool'n 'long er no wrack.  We's doin' blame' well,\n",
      "en we better let blame' well alone, as de good book says.  Like as not\n",
      "dey's a watchman on dat wrack.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Watchman your grandmother,\" I says; \"there ain't nothing to watch but\n",
      "the texas and the pilot-house; and do you reckon anybody's going to resk\n",
      "his life for a texas and a pilot-house such a night as this, when\n",
      "it's likely to break up and wash off down the river any minute?\"  Jim\n",
      "couldn't say nothing to that, so he didn't try.  \"And besides,\" I says,\n",
      "\"we might borrow something worth having out of the captain's stateroom.\n",
      " Seegars, I bet you--and cost five cents apiece, solid cash.  Steamboat\n",
      "captains is always rich, and get sixty dollars a month, and _they_ don't\n",
      "care a cent what a thing costs, you know, long as they want it.  Stick a\n",
      "candle in your pocket; I can't rest, Jim, till we give her a rummaging.\n",
      " Do you reckon Tom Sawyer would ever go by this thing?  Not for pie, he\n",
      "wouldn't. He'd call it an adventure--that's what he'd call it; and he'd\n",
      "land on that wreck if it was his last act.  And wouldn't he throw style\n",
      "into it?--wouldn't he spread himself, nor nothing?  Why, you'd think it\n",
      "was Christopher C'lumbus discovering Kingdom-Come.  I wish Tom Sawyer\n",
      "_was_ here.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "Jim he grumbled a little, but give in.  He said we mustn't talk any more\n",
      "than we could help, and then talk mighty low.  The lightning showed us\n",
      "the wreck again just in time, and we fetched the stabboard derrick, and\n",
      "made fast there.\n",
      "\n",
      "The deck was high out here.  We went sneaking down the slope of it to\n",
      "labboard, in the dark, towards the texas, feeling our way slow with our\n",
      "feet, and spreading our hands out to fend off the guys, for it was so\n",
      "dark we couldn't see no sign of them.  Pretty soon we struck the forward\n",
      "end of the skylight, and clumb on to it; and the next step fetched us in\n",
      "front of the captain's door, which was open, and by Jimminy, away down\n",
      "through the texas-hall we see a light! and all in the same second we\n",
      "seem to hear low voices in yonder!\n",
      "\n",
      "Jim whispered and said he was feeling powerful sick, and told me to come\n",
      "along.  I says, all right, and was going to start for the raft; but just\n",
      "then I heard a voice wail out and say:\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Oh, please don't, boys; I swear I won't ever tell!\"\n",
      "\n",
      "Another voice said, pretty loud:\n",
      "\n",
      "\"It's a lie, Jim Turner.  You've acted this way before.  You always want\n",
      "more'n your share of the truck, and you've always got it, too, because\n",
      "you've swore 't if you didn't you'd tell.  But this time you've said\n",
      "it jest one time too many.  You're the meanest, treacherousest hound in\n",
      "this country.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "By this time Jim was gone for the raft.  I was just a-biling with\n",
      "curiosity; and I says to myself, Tom Sawyer wouldn't back out now,\n",
      "and so I won't either; I'm a-going to see what's going on here.  So I\n",
      "dropped on my hands and knees in the little passage, and crept aft\n",
      "in the dark till there warn't but one stateroom betwixt me and the\n",
      "cross-hall of the texas.  Then in there I see a man stretched on the\n",
      "floor and tied hand and foot, and two men standing over him, and one\n",
      "of them had a dim lantern in his hand, and the other one had a pistol.\n",
      " This one kept pointing the pistol at the man's head on the floor, and\n",
      "saying:\n",

      "\"I'd _like_ to!  And I orter, too--a mean skunk!\"\n",
      "\n",

      "\n",
      "\"'Deed you _ain't!_  You never said no truer thing 'n that, you bet\n",
      "you.\" And once he said:  \"Hear him beg! and yit if we hadn't got the\n",
      "best of him and tied him he'd a killed us both.  And what _for_?  Jist\n",
      "for noth'n. Jist because we stood on our _rights_--that's what for.  But\n",

      "_up_ that pistol, Bill.\"\n",
      "\n",

      "\n",
      "\"I don't want to, Jake Packard.  I'm for killin' him--and didn't he kill\n",

      "\n",
      "\"But I don't _want_ him killed, and I've got my reasons for it.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Bless yo' heart for them words, Jake Packard!  I'll never forgit you\n",
      "long's I live!\" says the man on the floor, sort of blubbering.\n",
      "\n",
      "Packard didn't take no notice of that, but hung up his lantern on a nail\n",
      "and started towards where I was there in the dark, and motioned Bill\n",
      "to come.  I crawfished as fast as I could about two yards, but the boat\n",
      "slanted so that I couldn't make very good time; so to keep from getting\n",
      "run over and catched I crawled into a stateroom on the upper side.\n",

      "\n",
      "\"Here--come in here.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "And in he come, and Bill after him.  But before they got in I was up\n",
      "in the upper berth, cornered, and sorry I come.  Then they stood there,\n",
      "with their hands on the ledge of the berth, and talked.  I couldn't see\n",
      "them, but I could tell where they was by the whisky they'd been having.\n",
      " I was glad I didn't drink whisky; but it wouldn't made much difference\n",
      "anyway, because most of the time they couldn't a treed me because I\n",
      "didn't breathe.  I was too scared.  And, besides, a body _couldn't_\n",
      "breathe and hear such talk.  They talked low and earnest.  Bill wanted\n",

      "\n",
      "\"He's said he'll tell, and he will.  If we was to give both our shares\n",

      "you hear _me_.  I'm for putting him out of his troubles.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"So'm I,\" says Packard, very quiet.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Blame it, I'd sorter begun to think you wasn't.  Well, then, that's all\n",
      "right.  Le's go and do it.\"\n",

      "\"Hold on a minute; I hain't had my say yit.  You listen to me.\n",

      "done. But what I say is this:  it ain't good sense to go court'n around\n",
      "after a halter if you can git at what you're up to in some way that's\n",

      "\"You bet it is.  But how you goin' to manage it this time?\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Well, my idea is this:  we'll rustle around and gather up whatever\n",
      "pickins we've overlooked in the staterooms, and shove for shore and hide\n",
      "the truck. Then we'll wait.  Now I say it ain't a-goin' to be more'n two\n",
      "hours befo' this wrack breaks up and washes off down the river.  See?\n",
      "He'll be drownded, and won't have nobody to blame for it but his own\n",
      "self.  I reckon that's a considerble sight better 'n killin' of him.\n",
      " I'm unfavorable to killin' a man as long as you can git aroun' it; it\n",
      "ain't good sense, it ain't good morals.  Ain't I right?\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Yes, I reck'n you are.  But s'pose she _don't_ break up and wash off?\"\n",

      "_got_ to find that boat now--had to have it for ourselves.  So we went\n",
      "a-quaking and shaking down the stabboard side, and slow work it was,\n",

      "hardly any strength left, he said.  But I said, come on, if we get left\n",
      "on this wreck we are in a fix, sure.  So on we prowled again.  We struck\n",

      "\n",
      "We talked it all over.  It wouldn't do to take to the shore; we couldn't\n",
      "take the raft up the stream, of course.  There warn't no way but to wait\n",
      "for dark, and start back in the canoe and take the chances.  So we slept\n",

      "The place to buy canoes is off of rafts laying up at shore.  But we\n",

      "meanest thing to fog.  You can't tell the shape of the river, and you\n",
      "can't see no distance. It got to be very late and still, and then along\n",
      "comes a steamboat up the river.  We lit the lantern, and judged she\n",
      "would see it.  Up-stream boats didn't generly come close to us; they\n",

      "how close they can come without touching; sometimes the wheel bites off\n",
      "a sweep, and then the pilot sticks his head out and laughs, and thinks\n",
      "he's mighty smart.  Well, here she comes, and we said she was going to\n",
      "try and shave us; but she didn't seem to be sheering off a bit.  She\n",
      "was a big one, and she was coming in a hurry, too, looking like a black\n",
      "cloud with rows of glow-worms around it; but all of a sudden she bulged\n",
      "out, big and scary, with a long row of wide-open furnace doors shining\n",
      "like red-hot teeth, and her monstrous bows and guards hanging right\n",
      "over us.  There was a yell at us, and a jingling of bells to stop the\n",
      "engines, a powwow of cussing, and whistling of steam--and as Jim went\n",
      "overboard on one side and I on the other, she come smashing straight\n",

      "always stay under water a minute; this time I reckon I stayed under a\n",
      "minute and a half.  Then I bounced for the top in a hurry, for I was\n",
      "nearly busting.  I popped out to my armpits and blowed the water out of\n",
      "my nose, and puffed a bit.  Of course there was a booming current; and\n",
      "of course that boat started her engines again ten seconds after she\n",
      "stopped them, for they never cared much for raftsmen; so now she was\n",
      "churning along up the river, out of sight in the thick weather, though I\n",
      "could hear her.\n",
      "\n",
      "I sung out for Jim about a dozen times, but I didn't get any answer;\n",
      "so I grabbed a plank that touched me while I was \"treading water,\" and\n",
      "struck out for shore, shoving it ahead of me.  But I made out to see\n",
      "that the drift of the current was towards the left-hand shore, which\n",
      "meant that I was in a crossing; so I changed off and went that way.\n",
      "\n",
      "It was one of these long, slanting, two-mile crossings; so I was a good\n",
      "long time in getting over.  I made a safe landing, and clumb up the\n",
      "bank. I couldn't see but a little ways, but I went poking along over\n",
      "rough ground for a quarter of a mile or more, and then I run across a\n",
      "big old-fashioned double log-house before I noticed it.  I was going to\n",
      "rush by and get away, but a lot of dogs jumped out and went to howling\n",

      "of parlors in towns has beds in them.  There was a big fireplace that\n",
      "was bricked on the bottom, and the bricks was kept clean and red by\n",
      "pouring water on them and scrubbing them with another brick; sometimes\n",
      "they wash them over with red water-paint that they call Spanish-brown,\n",
      "same as they do in town.  They had big brass dog-irons that could hold\n",
      "up a saw-log. There was a clock on the middle of the mantelpiece, with\n",
      "a picture of a town painted on the bottom half of the glass front, and\n",
      "a round place in the middle of it for the sun, and you could see the\n",

      "and sometimes when one of these peddlers had been along and scoured her\n",
      "up and got her in good shape, she would start in and strike a hundred\n",

      "of a lovely crockery basket that had apples and oranges and peaches and\n",
      "grapes piled up in it, which was much redder and yellower and prettier\n",
      "than real ones is, but they warn't real because you could see where\n",

      "too, piled up perfectly exact, on each corner of the table.  One was a\n",
      "big family Bible full of pictures.  One was Pilgrim's Progress, about a\n",
      "man that left his family, it didn't say why.  I read considerable in it\n",
      "now and then.  The statements was interesting, but tough.  Another was\n",
      "Friendship's Offering, full of beautiful stuff and poetry; but I didn't\n",
      "read the poetry.  Another was Henry Clay's Speeches, and another was Dr.\n",
      "Gunn's Family Medicine, which told you all about what to do if a body\n",
      "was sick or dead.  There was a hymn book, and a lot of other books.  And\n",
      "there was nice split-bottom chairs, and perfectly sound, too--not bagged\n",

      "daughters which was dead made her own self when she was only\n",
      "fifteen years old.  They was different from any pictures I ever see\n",
      "before--blacker, mostly, than is common.  One was a woman in a slim black\n",
      "dress, belted small under the armpits, with bulges like a cabbage in\n",
      "the middle of the sleeves, and a large black scoop-shovel bonnet with\n",
      "a black veil, and white slim ankles crossed about with black tape, and\n",
      "very wee black slippers, like a chisel, and she was leaning pensive on a\n",
      "tombstone on her right elbow, under a weeping willow, and her other hand\n",
      "hanging down her side holding a white handkerchief and a reticule,\n",
      "and underneath the picture it said \"Shall I Never See Thee More Alas.\"\n",
      " Another one was a young lady with her hair all combed up straight\n",
      "to the top of her head, and knotted there in front of a comb like a\n",
      "chair-back, and she was crying into a handkerchief and had a dead bird\n",
      "laying on its back in her other hand with its heels up, and underneath\n",
      "the picture it said \"I Shall Never Hear Thy Sweet Chirrup More Alas.\"\n",
      " There was one where a young lady was at a window looking up at the\n",
      "moon, and tears running down her cheeks; and she had an open letter in\n",
      "one hand with black sealing wax showing on one edge of it, and she was\n",

      "the picture it said \"And Art Thou Gone Yes Thou Art Gone Alas.\"  These\n",
      "was all nice pictures, I reckon, but I didn't somehow seem to take\n",
      "to them, because if ever I was down a little they always give me the\n",
      "fan-tods.  Everybody was sorry she died, because she had laid out a lot\n",
      "more of these pictures to do, and a body could see by what she had done\n",
      "what they had lost.  But I reckoned that with her disposition she was\n",
      "having a better time in the graveyard.  She was at work on what they\n",
      "said was her greatest picture when she took sick, and every day and\n",
      "every night it was her prayer to be allowed to live till she got it\n",
      "done, but she never got the chance.  It was a picture of a young woman\n",
      "in a long white gown, standing on the rail of a bridge all ready to jump\n",
      "off, with her hair all down her back, and looking up to the moon, with\n",
      "the tears running down her face, and she had two arms folded across her\n",
      "breast, and two arms stretched out in front, and two more reaching up\n",
      "towards the moon--and the idea was to see which pair would look best,\n",
      "and then scratch out all the other arms; but, as I was saying, she died\n",
      "before she got her mind made up, and now they kept this picture over the\n",
      "head of the bed in her room, and every time her birthday come they hung\n",
      "flowers on it.  Other times it was hid with a little curtain.  The young\n",
      "woman in the picture had a kind of a nice sweet face, but there was so\n",
      "many arms it made her look too spidery, seemed to me.\n",
      "\n",
      "This young girl kept a scrap-book when she was alive, and used to paste\n",
      "obituaries and accidents and cases of patient suffering in it out of the\n",
      "Presbyterian Observer, and write poetry after them out of her own head.\n",

      "family, dead ones and all, and warn't going to let anything come between\n",

      "alive, and it didn't seem right that there warn't nobody to make some\n",
      "about her now she was gone; so I tried to sweat out a verse or two\n",

      "COL.  Grangerford was a gentleman, you see.  He was a gentleman all\n",
      "over; and so was his family.  He was well born, as the saying is, and\n",
      "that's worth as much in a man as it is in a horse, so the Widow Douglas\n",
      "said, and nobody ever denied that she was of the first aristocracy\n",
      "in our town; and pap he always said it, too, though he warn't no more\n",
      "quality than a mudcat himself.  Col.  Grangerford was very tall and\n",
      "very slim, and had a darkish-paly complexion, not a sign of red in it\n",
      "anywheres; he was clean shaved every morning all over his thin face, and\n",
      "he had the thinnest kind of lips, and the thinnest kind of nostrils, and\n",
      "a high nose, and heavy eyebrows, and the blackest kind of eyes, sunk so\n",
      "deep back that they seemed like they was looking out of caverns at\n",
      "you, as you may say.  His forehead was high, and his hair was black and\n",
      "straight and hung to his shoulders. His hands was long and thin, and\n",
      "every day of his life he put on a clean shirt and a full suit from head\n",
      "to foot made out of linen so white it hurt your eyes to look at it;\n",
      "and on Sundays he wore a blue tail-coat with brass buttons on it.  He\n",
      "carried a mahogany cane with a silver head to it.  There warn't no\n",
      "frivolishness about him, not a bit, and he warn't ever loud.  He was\n",
      "as kind as he could be--you could feel that, you know, and so you had\n",
      "confidence.  Sometimes he smiled, and it was good to see; but when he\n",
      "straightened himself up like a liberty-pole, and the lightning begun to\n",
      "flicker out from under his eyebrows, you wanted to climb a tree first,\n",
      "and find out what the matter was afterwards.  He didn't ever have to\n",
      "tell anybody to mind their manners--everybody was always good-mannered\n",
      "where he was.  Everybody loved to have him around, too; he was sunshine\n",
      "most always--I mean he made it seem like good weather.  When he turned\n",
      "into a cloudbank it was awful dark for half a minute, and that was\n",

      "Shepherdsons done the same.  It was pretty ornery preaching--all about\n",
      "brotherly love, and such-like tiresomeness; but everybody said it was\n",
      "a good sermon, and they all talked it over going home, and had such\n",
      "a powerful lot to say about faith and good works and free grace and\n",

      "TWO or three days and nights went by; I reckon I might say they swum by,\n",
      "they slid along so quiet and smooth and lovely.  Here is the way we put\n",
      "in the time.  It was a monstrous big river down there--sometimes a mile\n",
      "and a half wide; we run nights, and laid up and hid daytimes; soon as\n",
      "night was most gone we stopped navigating and tied up--nearly always\n",
      "in the dead water under a towhead; and then cut young cottonwoods and\n",
      "willows, and hid the raft with them.  Then we set out the lines.  Next\n",
      "we slid into the river and had a swim, so as to freshen up and cool\n",
      "off; then we set down on the sandy bottom where the water was about knee\n",
      "deep, and watched the daylight come.  Not a sound anywheres--perfectly\n",
      "still--just like the whole world was asleep, only sometimes the bullfrogs\n",
      "a-cluttering, maybe.  The first thing to see, looking away over the\n",
      "water, was a kind of dull line--that was the woods on t'other side; you\n",
      "couldn't make nothing else out; then a pale place in the sky; then more\n",
      "paleness spreading around; then the river softened up away off, and\n",
      "warn't black any more, but gray; you could see little dark spots\n",
      "drifting along ever so far away--trading scows, and such things; and\n",
      "long black streaks--rafts; sometimes you could hear a sweep screaking; or\n",
      "jumbled up voices, it was so still, and sounds come so far; and by and\n",
      "by you could see a streak on the water which you know by the look of the\n",
      "streak that there's a snag there in a swift current which breaks on it\n",
      "and makes that streak look that way; and you see the mist curl up off\n",
      "of the water, and the east reddens up, and the river, and you make out a\n",
      "log-cabin in the edge of the woods, away on the bank on t'other side of\n",
      "the river, being a woodyard, likely, and piled by them cheats so you can\n",
      "throw a dog through it anywheres; then the nice breeze springs up, and\n",
      "comes fanning you from over there, so cool and fresh and sweet to smell\n",
      "on account of the woods and the flowers; but sometimes not that way,\n",
      "because they've left dead fish laying around, gars and such, and they\n",
      "do get pretty rank; and next you've got the full day, and everything\n",
      "smiling in the sun, and the song-birds just going it!\n",
      "\n",
      "A little smoke couldn't be noticed now, so we would take some fish off\n",
      "of the lines and cook up a hot breakfast.  And afterwards we would watch\n",
      "the lonesomeness of the river, and kind of lazy along, and by and by\n",
      "lazy off to sleep.  Wake up by and by, and look to see what done it, and\n",
      "maybe see a steamboat coughing along up-stream, so far off towards the\n",
      "other side you couldn't tell nothing about her only whether she was\n",
      "a stern-wheel or side-wheel; then for about an hour there wouldn't be\n",
      "nothing to hear nor nothing to see--just solid lonesomeness.  Next\n",
      "you'd see a raft sliding by, away off yonder, and maybe a galoot on it\n",
      "chopping, because they're most always doing it on a raft; you'd see the\n",
      "axe flash and come down--you don't hear nothing; you see that axe go\n",
      "up again, and by the time it's above the man's head then you hear the\n",
      "_k'chunk_!--it had took all that time to come over the water.  So we\n",
      "would put in the day, lazying around, listening to the stillness.  Once\n",
      "there was a thick fog, and the rafts and things that went by was beating\n",
      "tin pans so the steamboats wouldn't run over them.  A scow or a\n",
      "raft went by so close we could hear them talking and cussing and\n",

      "Soon as it was night out we shoved; when we got her out to about the\n",
      "middle we let her alone, and let her float wherever the current wanted\n",
      "her to; then we lit the pipes, and dangled our legs in the water, and\n",
      "talked about all kinds of things--we was always naked, day and night,\n",
      "whenever the mosquitoes would let us--the new clothes Buck's folks made\n",
      "for me was too good to be comfortable, and besides I didn't go much on\n",

      "Sometimes we'd have that whole river all to ourselves for the longest\n",
      "time. Yonder was the banks and the islands, across the water; and maybe\n",
      "a spark--which was a candle in a cabin window; and sometimes on the water\n",
      "you could see a spark or two--on a raft or a scow, you know; and maybe\n",
      "you could hear a fiddle or a song coming over from one of them crafts.\n",
      "It's lovely to live on a raft.  We had the sky up there, all speckled\n",
      "with stars, and we used to lay on our backs and look up at them, and\n",
      "discuss about whether they was made or only just happened.  Jim he\n",

      "against it, because I've seen a frog lay most as many, so of course it\n",
      "could be done. We used to watch the stars that fell, too, and see them\n",
      "streak down.  Jim allowed they'd got spoiled and was hove out of the\n",
      "nest.\n",
      "\n",
      "Once or twice of a night we would see a steamboat slipping along in the\n",
      "dark, and now and then she would belch a whole world of sparks up out\n",
      "of her chimbleys, and they would rain down in the river and look awful\n",
      "pretty; then she would turn a corner and her lights would wink out and\n",
      "her powwow shut off and leave the river still again; and by and by her\n",
      "waves would get to us, a long time after she was gone, and joggle the\n",
      "raft a bit, and after that you wouldn't hear nothing for you couldn't\n",
      "tell how long, except maybe frogs or something.\n",
      "\n",
      "After midnight the people on shore went to bed, and then for two or\n",
      "three hours the shores was black--no more sparks in the cabin windows.\n",

      "the crick, here comes a couple of men tearing up the path as tight as\n",
      "they could foot it.  I thought I was a goner, for whenever anybody was\n",

      "shouting. We heard them come along towards the crick, but couldn't\n",
      "see them; they seemed to stop and fool around a while; then, as we got\n",

      "One of these fellows was about seventy or upwards, and had a bald head\n",

      "into his boot-tops, and home-knit galluses--no, he only had one.  He had\n",

      "\n",
      "Well, that was all easy, so we done it.  All through dinner Jim stood\n",

      "\n",
      "\"Hold!  What do you mean?\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Bilgewater, kin I trust you?\" says the old man, still sort of sobbing.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"To the bitter death!\"  He took the old man by the hand and squeezed it,\n",
      "and says, \"That secret of your being:  speak!\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Bilgewater, I am the late Dauphin!\"\n",

      "\n",
      "Well, he cried and took on so that me and Jim didn't know hardly what to\n",
      "do, we was so sorry--and so glad and proud we'd got him with us, too.\n",
      " So we set in, like we done before with the duke, and tried to comfort\n",
      "_him_. But he said it warn't no use, nothing but to be dead and done\n",
      "with it all could do him any good; though he said it often made him feel\n",
      "easier and better for a while if people treated him according to his\n",

      "\"Your Majesty,\" and waited on him first at meals, and didn't set down\n",

      "and doing this and that and t'other for him, and standing up till he\n",
      "told us we might set down.  This done him heaps of good, and so he\n",
      "got cheerful and comfortable.  But the duke kind of soured on him, and\n",
      "didn't look a bit satisfied with the way things was going; still,\n",
      "the king acted real friendly towards him, and said the duke's\n",
      "great-grandfather and all the other Dukes of Bilgewater was a good\n",
      "deal thought of by _his_ father, and was allowed to come to the palace\n",

      "\"Like as not we got to be together a blamed long time on this h-yer\n",

      "\n",
      "It didn't take me long to make up my mind that these liars warn't no\n",

      "never said nothing, never let on; kept it to myself; it's the best way;\n",

      "THEY asked us considerable many questions; wanted to know what we\n",

      "\n",
      "\"Goodness sakes! would a runaway nigger run _south_?\"\n",
      "\n",
      "No, they allowed he wouldn't.  I had to account for things some way, so\n",
      "I says:\n",
      "\n",
      "\"My folks was living in Pike County, in Missouri, where I was born, and\n",
      "they all died off but me and pa and my brother Ike.  Pa, he 'lowed\n",
      "he'd break up and go down and live with Uncle Ben, who's got a little\n",
      "one-horse place on the river, forty-four mile below Orleans.  Pa was\n",
      "pretty poor, and had some debts; so when he'd squared up there warn't\n",
      "nothing left but sixteen dollars and our nigger, Jim.  That warn't\n",
      "enough to take us fourteen hundred mile, deck passage nor no other way.\n",
      " Well, when the river rose pa had a streak of luck one day; he ketched\n",
      "this piece of a raft; so we reckoned we'd go down to Orleans on it.\n",
      " Pa's luck didn't hold out; a steamboat run over the forrard corner of\n",
      "the raft one night, and we all went overboard and dove under the wheel;\n",
      "Jim and me come up all right, but pa was drunk, and Ike was only four\n",
      "years old, so they never come up no more.  Well, for the next day or\n",
      "two we had considerable trouble, because people was always coming out in\n",
      "skiffs and trying to take Jim away from me, saying they believed he was\n",
      "a runaway nigger.  We don't run daytimes no more now; nights they don't\n",
      "bother us.\"\n",

      "The duke says:\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Leave me alone to cipher out a way so we can run in the daytime if we\n",
      "want to.  I'll think the thing over--I'll invent a plan that'll fix it.\n",
      "We'll let it alone for to-day, because of course we don't want to go by\n",
      "that town yonder in daylight--it mightn't be healthy.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "Towards night it begun to darken up and look like rain; the heat\n",
      "lightning was squirting around low down in the sky, and the leaves was\n",
      "beginning to shiver--it was going to be pretty ugly, it was easy to see\n",
      "that.  So the duke and the king went to overhauling our wigwam, to see\n",
      "what the beds was like.  My bed was a straw tick better than Jim's,\n",
      "which was a corn-shuck tick; there's always cobs around about in a shuck\n",
      "tick, and they poke into you and hurt; and when you roll over the dry\n",
      "shucks sound like you was rolling over in a pile of dead leaves; it\n",
      "makes such a rustling that you wake up.  Well, the duke allowed he would\n",
      "take my bed; but the king allowed he wouldn't.  He says:\n",
      "\n",
      "\"I should a reckoned the difference in rank would a sejested to you that\n",

      "\n",
      "Jim and me was in a sweat again for a minute, being afraid there was\n",
      "going to be some more trouble amongst them; so we was pretty glad when\n",
      "the duke says:\n",
      "\n",
      "\"'Tis my fate to be always ground into the mire under the iron heel of\n",
      "oppression.  Misfortune has broken my once haughty spirit; I yield, I\n",

      "We got away as soon as it was good and dark.  The king told us to stand\n",
      "well out towards the middle of the river, and not show a light till we\n",
      "got a long ways below the town.  We come in sight of the little bunch of\n",
      "lights by and by--that was the town, you know--and slid by, about a half\n",
      "a mile out, all right.  When we was three-quarters of a mile below we\n",
      "hoisted up our signal lantern; and about ten o'clock it come on to rain\n",
      "and blow and thunder and lighten like everything; so the king told us\n",
      "to both stay on watch till the weather got better; then him and the duke\n",
      "crawled into the wigwam and turned in for the night.  It was my watch\n",
      "below till twelve, but I wouldn't a turned in anyway if I'd had a bed,\n",
      "because a body don't see such a storm as that every day in the week, not\n",
      "by a long sight.  My souls, how the wind did scream along!  And every\n",
      "second or two there'd come a glare that lit up the white-caps for a half\n",
      "a mile around, and you'd see the islands looking dusty through the rain,\n",
      "and the trees thrashing around in the wind; then comes a H-WHACK!--bum!\n",
      "bum! bumble-umble-um-bum-bum-bum-bum--and the thunder would go rumbling\n",
      "and grumbling away, and quit--and then RIP comes another flash and\n",
      "another sockdolager.  The waves most washed me off the raft sometimes,\n",
      "but I hadn't any clothes on, and didn't mind.  We didn't have no trouble\n",
      "about snags; the lightning was glaring and flittering around so constant\n",
      "that we could see them plenty soon enough to throw her head this way or\n",
      "that and miss them.\n",
      "\n",
      "I had the middle watch, you know, but I was pretty sleepy by that time,\n",
      "so Jim he said he would stand the first half of it for me; he was always\n",
      "mighty good that way, Jim was.  I crawled into the wigwam, but the king\n",
      "and the duke had their legs sprawled around so there warn't no show for\n",
      "me; so I laid outside--I didn't mind the rain, because it was warm, and\n",
      "the waves warn't running so high now.  About two they come up again,\n",
      "though, and Jim was going to call me; but he changed his mind, because\n",
      "he reckoned they warn't high enough yet to do any harm; but he was\n",
      "mistaken about that, for pretty soon all of a sudden along comes a\n",
      "regular ripper and washed me overboard.  It most killed Jim a-laughing.\n",
      " He was the easiest nigger to laugh that ever was, anyway.\n",
      "\n",
      "I took the watch, and Jim he laid down and snored away; and by and by\n",
      "the storm let up for good and all; and the first cabin-light that showed\n",
      "I rousted him out, and we slid the raft into hiding quarters for the\n",
      "day.\n",
      "\n",
      "The king got out an old ratty deck of cards after breakfast, and him\n",
      "and the duke played seven-up a while, five cents a game.  Then they got\n",
      "tired of it, and allowed they would \"lay out a campaign,\" as they called\n",
      "it. The duke went down into his carpet-bag, and fetched up a lot of\n",
      "little printed bills and read them out loud.  One bill said, \"The\n",

      "\"But the histrionic muse is the darling.  Have you ever trod the boards,\n",

      "So the duke he told him all about who Romeo was and who Juliet was, and\n",

      "\n",
      "\"No, don't you worry; these country jakes won't ever think of that.\n",
      "Besides, you know, you'll be in costume, and that makes all the\n",
      "difference in the world; Juliet's in a balcony, enjoying the moonlight\n",
      "before she goes to bed, and she's got on her night-gown and her ruffled\n",
      "nightcap.  Here are the costumes for the parts.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "He got out two or three curtain-calico suits, which he said was\n",
      "meedyevil armor for Richard III. and t'other chap, and a long white\n",
      "cotton nightshirt and a ruffled nightcap to match.  The king was\n",
      "satisfied; so the duke got out his book and read the parts over in the\n",
      "most splendid spread-eagle way, prancing around and acting at the same\n",
      "time, to show how it had got to be done; then he give the book to the\n",
      "king and told him to get his part by heart.\n",
      "\n",
      "There was a little one-horse town about three mile down the bend, and\n",
      "after dinner the duke said he had ciphered out his idea about how to run\n",
      "in daylight without it being dangersome for Jim; so he allowed he would\n",
      "go down to the town and fix that thing.  The king allowed he would go,\n",
      "too, and see if he couldn't strike something.  We was out of coffee, so\n",
      "Jim said I better go along with them in the canoe and get some.\n",
      "\n",
      "When we got there there warn't nobody stirring; streets empty, and\n",
      "perfectly dead and still, like Sunday.  We found a sick nigger sunning\n",
      "himself in a back yard, and he said everybody that warn't too young or\n",
      "too sick or too old was gone to camp-meeting, about two mile back in the\n",
      "woods.  The king got the directions, and allowed he'd go and work that\n",
      "camp-meeting for all it was worth, and I might go, too.\n",
      "\n",
      "The duke said what he was after was a printing-office.  We found it;\n",
      "a little bit of a concern, up over a carpenter shop--carpenters and\n",
      "printers all gone to the meeting, and no doors locked.  It was a dirty,\n",
      "littered-up place, and had ink marks, and handbills with pictures of\n",
      "horses and runaway niggers on them, all over the walls.  The duke shed\n",
      "his coat and said he was all right now.  So me and the king lit out for\n",
      "the camp-meeting.\n",
      "\n",
      "We got there in about a half an hour fairly dripping, for it was a most\n",
      "awful hot day.  There was as much as a thousand people there from\n",
      "twenty mile around.  The woods was full of teams and wagons, hitched\n",
      "everywheres, feeding out of the wagon-troughs and stomping to keep\n",
      "off the flies.  There was sheds made out of poles and roofed over with\n",
      "branches, where they had lemonade and gingerbread to sell, and piles of\n",
      "watermelons and green corn and such-like truck.\n",
      "\n",
      "The preaching was going on under the same kinds of sheds, only they was\n",
      "bigger and held crowds of people.  The benches was made out of outside\n",
      "slabs of logs, with holes bored in the round side to drive sticks into\n",
      "for legs. They didn't have no backs.  The preachers had high platforms\n",
      "to stand on at one end of the sheds.  The women had on sun-bonnets;\n",
      "and some had linsey-woolsey frocks, some gingham ones, and a few of the\n",
      "young ones had on calico.  Some of the young men was barefooted, and\n",
      "some of the children didn't have on any clothes but just a tow-linen\n",
      "shirt.  Some of the old women was knitting, and some of the young folks\n",
      "was courting on the sly.\n",
      "\n",
      "The first shed we come to the preacher was lining out a hymn.  He lined\n",
      "out two lines, everybody sung it, and it was kind of grand to hear it,\n",
      "there was so many of them and they done it in such a rousing way; then\n",
      "he lined out two more for them to sing--and so on.  The people woke up\n",
      "more and more, and sung louder and louder; and towards the end some\n",
      "begun to groan, and some begun to shout.  Then the preacher begun to\n",
      "preach, and begun in earnest, too; and went weaving first to one side of\n",
      "the platform and then the other, and then a-leaning down over the front\n",
      "of it, with his arms and his body going all the time, and shouting his\n",
      "words out with all his might; and every now and then he would hold up\n",
      "his Bible and spread it open, and kind of pass it around this way and\n",
      "that, shouting, \"It's the brazen serpent in the wilderness!  Look upon\n",
      "it and live!\"  And people would shout out, \"Glory!--A-a-_men_!\"  And so\n",
      "he went on, and the people groaning and crying and saying amen:\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Oh, come to the mourners' bench! come, black with sin! (_Amen_!) come,\n",
      "sick and sore! (_Amen_!) come, lame and halt and blind! (_Amen_!) come,\n",
      "pore and needy, sunk in shame! (_A-A-Men_!) come, all that's worn and\n",
      "soiled and suffering!--come with a broken spirit! come with a contrite\n",
      "heart! come in your rags and sin and dirt! the waters that cleanse\n",
      "is free, the door of heaven stands open--oh, enter in and be at rest!\"\n",
      "(_A-A-Men_!  _Glory, Glory Hallelujah!_)\n",
      "\n",
      "And so on.  You couldn't make out what the preacher said any more, on\n",
      "account of the shouting and crying.  Folks got up everywheres in the\n",
      "crowd, and worked their way just by main strength to the mourners'\n",
      "bench, with the tears running down their faces; and when all the\n",
      "mourners had got up there to the front benches in a crowd, they sung and\n",
      "shouted and flung themselves down on the straw, just crazy and wild.\n",
      "\n",
      "Well, the first I knowed the king got a-going, and you could hear him\n",
      "over everybody; and next he went a-charging up on to the platform, and\n",
      "the preacher he begged him to speak to the people, and he done it.  He\n",
      "told them he was a pirate--been a pirate for thirty years out in the\n",
      "Indian Ocean--and his crew was thinned out considerable last spring in\n",
      "a fight, and he was home now to take out some fresh men, and thanks to\n",
      "goodness he'd been robbed last night and put ashore off of a steamboat\n",
      "without a cent, and he was glad of it; it was the blessedest thing that\n",
      "ever happened to him, because he was a changed man now, and happy for\n",
      "the first time in his life; and, poor as he was, he was going to start\n",
      "right off and work his way back to the Indian Ocean, and put in the rest\n",
      "of his life trying to turn the pirates into the true path; for he could\n",
      "do it better than anybody else, being acquainted with all pirate crews\n",

      "lay them out in their regular turns, but he couldn't wait now because\n",
      "he'd come to town to kill old Colonel Sherburn, and his motto was, \"Meat\n",
      "first, and spoon vittles to top off on.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "He see me, and rode up and says:\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Whar'd you come f'm, boy?  You prepared to die?\"\n",
      "\n",
      "Then he rode on.  I was scared, but a man says:\n",
      "\n",
      "\"He don't mean nothing; he's always a-carryin' on like that when he's\n",
      "drunk.  He's the best naturedest old fool in Arkansaw--never hurt nobody,\n",

      "\n",
      "Boggs rode up before the biggest store in town, and bent his head down\n",
      "so he could see under the curtain of the awning and yells:\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Come out here, Sherburn! Come out and meet the man you've swindled.\n",
      "You're the houn' I'm after, and I'm a-gwyne to have you, too!\"\n",
      "\n",
      "And so he went on, calling Sherburn everything he could lay his tongue\n",
      "to, and the whole street packed with people listening and laughing and\n",
      "going on.  By and by a proud-looking man about fifty-five--and he was a\n",
      "heap the best dressed man in that town, too--steps out of the store, and\n",
      "the crowd drops back on each side to let him come.  He says to Boggs,\n",
      "mighty ca'm and slow--he says:\n",
      "\n",
      "\"I'm tired of this, but I'll endure it till one o'clock.  Till one\n",
      "o'clock, mind--no longer.  If you open your mouth against me only once\n",
      "after that time you can't travel so far but I will find you.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "Then he turns and goes in.  The crowd looked mighty sober; nobody\n",
      "stirred, and there warn't no more laughing.  Boggs rode off\n",
      "blackguarding Sherburn as loud as he could yell, all down the street;\n",
      "and pretty soon back he comes and stops before the store, still keeping\n",
      "it up.  Some men crowded around him and tried to get him to shut up,\n",
      "but he wouldn't; they told him it would be one o'clock in about fifteen\n",
      "minutes, and so he _must_ go home--he must go right away.  But it didn't\n",
      "do no good.  He cussed away with all his might, and throwed his hat down\n",
      "in the mud and rode over it, and pretty soon away he went a-raging down\n",
      "the street again, with his gray hair a-flying. Everybody that could get\n",
      "a chance at him tried their best to coax him off of his horse so they\n",
      "could lock him up and get him sober; but it warn't no use--up the street\n",
      "he would tear again, and give Sherburn another cussing.  By and by\n",
      "somebody says:\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Go for his daughter!--quick, go for his daughter; sometimes he'll listen\n",
      "to her.  If anybody can persuade him, she can.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "So somebody started on a run.  I walked down street a ways and stopped.\n",
      "In about five or ten minutes here comes Boggs again, but not on his\n",
      "horse.  He was a-reeling across the street towards me, bare-headed, with\n",
      "a friend on both sides of him a-holt of his arms and hurrying him along.\n",
      "He was quiet, and looked uneasy; and he warn't hanging back any, but was\n",
      "doing some of the hurrying himself.  Somebody sings out:\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Boggs!\"\n",
      "\n",
      "I looked over there to see who said it, and it was that Colonel\n",
      "Sherburn. He was standing perfectly still in the street, and had a\n",
      "pistol raised in his right hand--not aiming it, but holding it out with\n",
      "the barrel tilted up towards the sky.  The same second I see a young\n",
      "girl coming on the run, and two men with her.  Boggs and the men turned\n",
      "round to see who called him, and when they see the pistol the men\n",
      "jumped to one side, and the pistol-barrel come down slow and steady to\n",
      "a level--both barrels cocked. Boggs throws up both of his hands and says,\n",
      "\"O Lord, don't shoot!\"  Bang! goes the first shot, and he staggers back,\n",
      "clawing at the air--bang! goes the second one, and he tumbles backwards\n",
      "on to the ground, heavy and solid, with his arms spread out.  That young\n",
      "girl screamed out and comes rushing, and down she throws herself on her\n",
      "father, crying, and saying, \"Oh, he's killed him, he's killed him!\"  The\n",
      "crowd closed up around them, and shouldered and jammed one another, with\n",
      "their necks stretched, trying to see, and people on the inside trying to\n",
      "shove them back and shouting, \"Back, back! give him air, give him air!\"\n",

      "Colonel Sherburn he tossed his pistol on to the ground, and turned\n",
      "around on his heels and walked off.\n",
      "\n",
      "They took Boggs to a little drug store, the crowd pressing around just\n",
      "the same, and the whole town following, and I rushed and got a good\n",
      "place at the window, where I was close to him and could see in.  They\n",
      "laid him on the floor and put one large Bible under his head, and opened\n",
      "another one and spread it on his breast; but they tore open his shirt\n",
      "first, and I seen where one of the bullets went in.  He made about a\n",
      "dozen long gasps, his breast lifting the Bible up when he drawed in his\n",
      "breath, and letting it down again when he breathed it out--and after that\n",
      "he laid still; he was dead.  Then they pulled his daughter away from\n",
      "him, screaming and crying, and took her off.  She was about sixteen, and\n",
      "very sweet and gentle looking, but awful pale and scared.\n",
      "\n",
      "Well, pretty soon the whole town was there, squirming and scrouging and\n",
      "pushing and shoving to get at the window and have a look, but people\n",
      "that had the places wouldn't give them up, and folks behind them was\n",
      "saying all the time, \"Say, now, you've looked enough, you fellows;\n",

      "you.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "There was considerable jawing back, so I slid out, thinking maybe\n",
      "there was going to be trouble.  The streets was full, and everybody was\n",
      "excited. Everybody that seen the shooting was telling how it happened,\n",
      "and there was a big crowd packed around each one of these fellows,\n",
      "stretching their necks and listening.  One long, lanky man, with long\n",
      "hair and a big white fur stovepipe hat on the back of his head, and a\n",
      "crooked-handled cane, marked out the places on the ground where Boggs\n",
      "stood and where Sherburn stood, and the people following him around from\n",
      "one place to t'other and watching everything he done, and bobbing their\n",
      "heads to show they understood, and stooping a little and resting their\n",
      "hands on their thighs to watch him mark the places on the ground with\n",
      "his cane; and then he stood up straight and stiff where Sherburn had\n",
      "stood, frowning and having his hat-brim down over his eyes, and sung\n",
      "out, \"Boggs!\" and then fetched his cane down slow to a level, and says\n",
      "\"Bang!\" staggered backwards, says \"Bang!\" again, and fell down flat on\n",
      "his back. The people that had seen the thing said he done it perfect;\n",
      "said it was just exactly the way it all happened.  Then as much as a\n",
      "dozen people got out their bottles and treated him.\n",
      "\n",
      "Well, by and by somebody said Sherburn ought to be lynched.  In about a\n",

      "to mush, and it was awful to see.  Children was heeling it ahead of the\n",

      "the road was full of women's heads, and there was nigger boys in every\n",
      "tree, and bucks and wenches looking over every fence; and as soon as the\n",
      "mob would get nearly to them they would break and skaddle back out of\n",

      "most to death.\n",
      "\n",
      "They swarmed up in front of Sherburn's palings as thick as they could\n",
      "jam together, and you couldn't hear yourself think for the noise.  It\n",
      "was a little twenty-foot yard.  Some sung out \"Tear down the fence! tear\n",
      "down the fence!\"  Then there was a racket of ripping and tearing and\n",

      "out-gaze him, but they couldn't; they dropped their eyes and looked\n",
      "sneaky. Then pretty soon Sherburn sort of laughed; not the pleasant\n",
      "kind, but the kind that makes you feel like when you are eating bread\n",
      "that's got sand in it.\n",

      "comfortable--there must a been twenty of them--and every lady with a\n",
      "lovely complexion, and perfectly beautiful, and looking just like a gang\n",
      "of real sure-enough queens, and dressed in clothes that cost millions of\n",
      "dollars, and just littered with diamonds.  It was a powerful fine sight;\n",
      "I never see anything so lovely.  And then one by one they got up\n",

      "graceful, the men looking ever so tall and airy and straight, with their\n",

      "as a wink with the funniest things a body ever said; and how he ever\n",

      "come to a standstill.  Then the people begun to holler at him and make\n",
      "fun of him, and that made him mad, and he begun to rip and tear; so that\n",
      "stirred up the people, and a lot of men begun to pile down off of the\n",
      "benches and swarm towards the ring, saying, \"Knock him down! throw him\n",
      "out!\" and one or two women begun to scream.  So, then, the ringmaster\n",

      "trouble he would let him ride if he thought he could stay on the horse.\n",
      " So everybody laughed and said all right, and the man got on. The minute\n",
      "he was on, the horse begun to rip and tear and jump and cavort around,\n",
      "with two circus men hanging on to his bridle trying to hold him, and the\n",
      "drunk man hanging on to his neck, and his heels flying in the air every\n",
      "jump, and the whole crowd of people standing up shouting and laughing\n",
      "till tears rolled down.  And at last, sure enough, all the circus men\n",
      "could do, the horse broke loose, and away he went like the very nation,\n",
      "round and round the ring, with that sot laying down on him and hanging\n",
      "to his neck, with first one leg hanging most to the ground on one side,\n",
      "and then t'other one on t'other side, and the people just crazy.  It\n",
      "warn't funny to me, though; I was all of a tremble to see his danger.\n",
      " But pretty soon he struggled up astraddle and grabbed the bridle,\n",
      "a-reeling this way and that; and the next minute he sprung up and\n",
      "dropped the bridle and stood! and the horse a-going like a house afire\n",
      "too.  He just stood up there, a-sailing around as easy and comfortable\n",
      "as if he warn't ever drunk in his life--and then he begun to pull off his\n",
      "clothes and sling them.  He shed them so thick they kind of clogged up\n",
      "the air, and altogether he shed seventeen suits. And, then, there he\n",
      "was, slim and handsome, and dressed the gaudiest and prettiest you\n",
      "ever saw, and he lit into that horse with his whip and made him fairly\n",
      "hum--and finally skipped off, and made his bow and danced off to\n",
      "the dressing-room, and everybody just a-howling with pleasure and\n",
      "astonishment.\n",
      "\n",
      "Then the ringmaster he see how he had been fooled, and he _was_ the\n",

      "lay all day in the wigwam tied with the rope.  You see, when we left him\n",

      "by himself and not tied it wouldn't look much like he was a runaway\n",
      "nigger, you know. So the duke said it _was_ kind of hard to have to lay\n",
      "roped all day, and he'd cipher out some way to get around it.\n",
      "\n",
      "He was uncommon bright, the duke was, and he soon struck it.  He dressed\n",
      "Jim up in King Lear's outfit--it was a long curtain-calico gown, and a\n",
      "white horse-hair wig and whiskers; and then he took his theater paint\n",
      "and painted Jim's face and hands and ears and neck all over a dead,\n",
      "dull, solid blue, like a man that's been drownded nine days.  Blamed if\n",

      "\n",
      "Sick Arab--but harmless when not out of his head.\n",
      "\n",
      "And he nailed that shingle to a lath, and stood the lath up four or five\n",
      "foot in front of the wigwam.  Jim was satisfied.  He said it was a sight\n",
      "better than lying tied a couple of years every day, and trembling all\n",
      "over every time there was a sound.  The duke told him to make himself\n",
      "free and easy, and if anybody ever come meddling around, he must hop\n",
      "out of the wigwam, and carry on a little, and fetch a howl or two like\n",
      "a wild beast, and he reckoned they would light out and leave him alone.\n",
      " Which was sound enough judgment; but you take the average man, and he\n",
      "wouldn't wait for him to howl.  Why, he didn't only look like he was\n",
      "dead, he looked considerable more than that.\n",
      "\n",
      "These rapscallions wanted to try the Nonesuch again, because there was\n",

      "something on the Arkansaw village; and the king he allowed he would drop\n",
      "over to t'other village without any plan, but just trust in Providence\n",
      "to lead him the profitable way--meaning the devil, I reckon.  We had all\n",
      "bought store clothes where we stopped last; and now the king put his'n\n",
      "on, and he told me to put mine on.  I done it, of course.  The king's\n",
      "duds was all black, and he did look real swell and starchy.  I never\n",
      "knowed how clothes could change a body before.  Why, before, he looked\n",
      "like the orneriest old rip that ever was; but now, when he'd take off\n",
      "his new white beaver and make a bow and do a smile, he looked that grand\n",
      "and good and pious that you'd say he had walked right out of the ark,\n",
      "and maybe was old Leviticus himself.  Jim cleaned up the canoe, and I\n",
      "got my paddle ready.  There was a big steamboat laying at the shore away\n",

      "won't do. He might tell who told him; then the king and the duke would\n",
      "make it warm for me.  Shall I go, private, and tell Mary Jane?  No--I\n",
      "dasn't do it. Her face would give them a hint, sure; they've got the\n",
      "money, and they'd slide right out and get away with it.  If she was to\n",
      "fetch in help I'd get mixed up in the business before it was done with,\n",
      "I judge.  No; there ain't no good way but one.  I got to steal that\n",
      "money, somehow; and I got to steal it some way that they won't suspicion\n",
      "that I done it. They've got a good thing here, and they ain't a-going\n",
      "to leave till they've played this family and this town for all they're\n",
      "worth, so I'll find a chance time enough. I'll steal it and hide it; and\n",
      "by and by, when I'm away down the river, I'll write a letter and tell\n",
      "Mary Jane where it's hid.  But I better hive it tonight if I can,\n",

      "\n",
      "So, thinks I, I'll go and search them rooms.  Upstairs the hall was\n",
      "dark, but I found the duke's room, and started to paw around it with\n",
      "my hands; but I recollected it wouldn't be much like the king to let\n",
      "anybody else take care of that money but his own self; so then I went to\n",
      "his room and begun to paw around there.  But I see I couldn't do nothing\n",
      "without a candle, and I dasn't light one, of course.  So I judged I'd\n",
      "got to do the other thing--lay for them and eavesdrop.  About that time\n",
      "I hears their footsteps coming, and was going to skip under the bed; I\n",
      "reached for it, but it wasn't where I thought it would be; but I touched\n",
      "the curtain that hid Mary Jane's frocks, so I jumped in behind that and\n",
      "snuggled in amongst the gowns, and stood there perfectly still.\n",
      "\n",
      "They come in and shut the door; and the first thing the duke done was to\n",
      "get down and look under the bed.  Then I was glad I hadn't found the bed\n",
      "when I wanted it.  And yet, you know, it's kind of natural to hide under\n",
      "the bed when you are up to anything private.  They sets down then, and\n",
      "the king says:\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Well, what is it?  And cut it middlin' short, because it's better for\n",

      "\n",

      "truth this time, though it does seem most like setting down on a kag of\n",

      "an imitation.  I can't give the old gent's words, nor I can't imitate\n",
      "him; but he turned around to the crowd, and says, about like this:\n",

      "\"This is a surprise to me which I wasn't looking for; and I'll\n",

      "\n",
      "\"Gentlemen, I wish the money was there, for I ain't got no disposition\n",

      "no, but I see them sneaking out of the room and hustling away, and I\n",
      "never thought nothing, only I reckoned they was afraid they had waked up\n",
      "my master and was trying to get away before he made trouble with them.\n",

      "it, up and down, hour in, hour out, and nobody never said a word about\n",
      "supper, nor ever seemed to think about it--and so they kept it up, and\n",
      "kept it up; and it _was_ the worst mixed-up thing you ever see.  They\n",
      "made the king tell his yarn, and they made the old gentleman tell his'n;\n",
      "and anybody but a lot of prejudiced chuckleheads would a _seen_ that the\n",
      "old gentleman was spinning truth and t'other one lies.  And by and by\n",
      "they had me up to tell what I knowed.  The king he give me a left-handed\n",
      "look out of the corner of his eye, and so I knowed enough to talk on the\n",
      "right side.  I begun to tell about Sheffield, and how we lived there,\n",
      "and all about the English Wilkses, and so on; but I didn't get pretty\n",
      "fur till the doctor begun to laugh; and Levi Bell, the lawyer, says:\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Set down, my boy; I wouldn't strain myself if I was you.  I reckon\n",
      "you ain't used to lying, it don't seem to come handy; what you want is\n",
      "practice.  You do it pretty awkward.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "I didn't care nothing for the compliment, but I was glad to be let off,\n",
      "anyway.\n",
      "\n",
      "The doctor he started to say something, and turns and says:\n",
      "\n",
      "\"If you'd been in town at first, Levi Bell--\" The king broke in and\n",
      "reached out his hand, and says:\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Why, is this my poor dead brother's old friend that he's wrote so often\n",
      "about?\"\n",
      "\n",
      "The lawyer and him shook hands, and the lawyer smiled and looked\n",
      "pleased, and they talked right along awhile, and then got to one side\n",
      "and talked low; and at last the lawyer speaks up and says:\n",
      "\n",
      "\"That 'll fix it.  I'll take the order and send it, along with your\n",
      "brother's, and then they'll know it's all right.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "So they got some paper and a pen, and the king he set down and twisted\n",
      "his head to one side, and chawed his tongue, and scrawled off something;\n",
      "and then they give the pen to the duke--and then for the first time the\n",
      "duke looked sick.  But he took the pen and wrote.  So then the lawyer\n",
      "turns to the new old gentleman and says:\n",
      "\n",
      "\"You and your brother please write a line or two and sign your names.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "The old gentleman wrote, but nobody couldn't read it.  The lawyer looked\n",
      "powerful astonished, and says:\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Well, it beats _me_\"--and snaked a lot of old letters out of his pocket,\n",
      "and examined them, and then examined the old man's writing, and then\n",
      "_them_ again; and then says:  \"These old letters is from Harvey Wilks;\n",
      "and here's _these_ two handwritings, and anybody can see they didn't\n",
      "write them\" (the king and the duke looked sold and foolish, I tell\n",
      "you, to see how the lawyer had took them in), \"and here's _this_ old\n",
      "gentleman's hand writing, and anybody can tell, easy enough, _he_ didn't\n",
      "write them--fact is, the scratches he makes ain't properly _writing_ at\n",
      "all.  Now, here's some letters from--\"\n",
      "\n",
      "The new old gentleman says:\n",
      "\n",
      "\"If you please, let me explain.  Nobody can read my hand but my brother\n",
      "there--so he copies for me.  It's _his_ hand you've got there, not mine.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"_Well_!\" says the lawyer, \"this _is_ a state of things.  I've got some\n",
      "of William's letters, too; so if you'll get him to write a line or so we\n",
      "can com--\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"He _can't_ write with his left hand,\" says the old gentleman.  \"If he\n",
      "could use his right hand, you would see that he wrote his own letters\n",
      "and mine too.  Look at both, please--they're by the same hand.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "The lawyer done it, and says:\n",
      "\n",
      "\"I believe it's so--and if it ain't so, there's a heap stronger\n",
      "resemblance than I'd noticed before, anyway.  Well, well, well!  I\n",
      "thought we was right on the track of a solution, but it's gone to grass,\n",
      "partly.  But anyway, one thing is proved--_these_ two ain't either of 'em\n",
      "Wilkses\"--and he wagged his head towards the king and the duke.\n",
      "\n",
      "Well, what do you think?  That muleheaded old fool wouldn't give in\n",
      "_then_! Indeed he wouldn't.  Said it warn't no fair test.  Said his\n",
      "brother William was the cussedest joker in the world, and hadn't tried\n",
      "to write--_he_ see William was going to play one of his jokes the minute\n",
      "he put the pen to paper.  And so he warmed up and went warbling and\n",
      "warbling right along till he was actuly beginning to believe what he was\n",
      "saying _himself_; but pretty soon the new gentleman broke in, and says:\n",
      "\n",
      "\"I've thought of something.  Is there anybody here that helped to lay\n",
      "out my br--helped to lay out the late Peter Wilks for burying?\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Yes,\" says somebody, \"me and Ab Turner done it.  We're both here.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "Then the old man turns towards the king, and says:\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Perhaps this gentleman can tell me what was tattooed on his breast?\"\n",
      "\n",
      "Blamed if the king didn't have to brace up mighty quick, or he'd a\n",
      "squshed down like a bluff bank that the river has cut under, it took\n",
      "him so sudden; and, mind you, it was a thing that was calculated to make\n",
      "most _anybody_ sqush to get fetched such a solid one as that without any\n",
      "notice, because how was _he_ going to know what was tattooed on the man?\n",
      " He whitened a little; he couldn't help it; and it was mighty still in\n",
      "there, and everybody bending a little forwards and gazing at him.  Says\n",
      "I to myself, _now_ he'll throw up the sponge--there ain't no more use.\n",
      " Well, did he?  A body can't hardly believe it, but he didn't.  I reckon\n",
      "he thought he'd keep the thing up till he tired them people out, so\n",
      "they'd thin out, and him and the duke could break loose and get away.\n",
      " Anyway, he set there, and pretty soon he begun to smile, and says:\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Mf!  It's a _very_ tough question, _ain't_ it!  _yes_, sir, I k'n\n",
      "tell you what's tattooed on his breast.  It's jest a small, thin, blue\n",
      "arrow--that's what it is; and if you don't look clost, you can't see it.\n",
      " _now_ what do you say--hey?\"\n",
      "\n",
      "Well, I never see anything like that old blister for clean out-and-out\n",
      "cheek.\n",
      "\n",
      "The new old gentleman turns brisk towards Ab Turner and his pard, and\n",
      "his eye lights up like he judged he'd got the king _this_ time, and\n",
      "says:\n",
      "\n",
      "\"There--you've heard what he said!  Was there any such mark on Peter\n",
      "Wilks' breast?\"\n",
      "\n",
      "Both of them spoke up and says:\n",
      "\n",
      "\"We didn't see no such mark.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Good!\" says the old gentleman.  \"Now, what you _did_ see on his breast\n",
      "was a small dim P, and a B (which is an initial he dropped when he was\n",
      "young), and a W, with dashes between them, so:  P--B--W\"--and he marked\n",
      "them that way on a piece of paper.  \"Come, ain't that what you saw?\"\n",
      "\n",
      "Both of them spoke up again, and says:\n",
      "\n",
      "\"No, we _didn't_.  We never seen any marks at all.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "Well, everybody _was_ in a state of mind now, and they sings out:\n",
      "\n",
      "\"The whole _bilin_' of 'm 's frauds!  Le's duck 'em! le's drown 'em!\n",
      "le's ride 'em on a rail!\" and everybody was whooping at once, and there\n",
      "was a rattling powwow.  But the lawyer he jumps on the table and yells,\n",
      "and says:\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Gentlemen--gentle_men!_  Hear me just a word--just a _single_ word--if you\n",
      "_please_!  There's one way yet--let's go and dig up the corpse and look.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "That took them.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Hooray!\" they all shouted, and was starting right off; but the lawyer\n",
      "and the doctor sung out:\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Hold on, hold on!  Collar all these four men and the boy, and fetch\n",
      "_them_ along, too!\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"We'll do it!\" they all shouted; \"and if we don't find them marks we'll\n",
      "lynch the whole gang!\"\n",
      "\n",
      "I _was_ scared, now, I tell you.  But there warn't no getting away, you\n",
      "know. They gripped us all, and marched us right along, straight for the\n",
      "graveyard, which was a mile and a half down the river, and the whole\n",
      "town at our heels, for we made noise enough, and it was only nine in the\n",
      "evening.\n",
      "\n",
      "As we went by our house I wished I hadn't sent Mary Jane out of town;\n",
      "because now if I could tip her the wink she'd light out and save me, and\n",
      "blow on our dead-beats.\n",
      "\n",
      "Well, we swarmed along down the river road, just carrying on like\n",
      "wildcats; and to make it more scary the sky was darking up, and the\n",
      "lightning beginning to wink and flitter, and the wind to shiver amongst\n",
      "the leaves. This was the most awful trouble and most dangersome I ever\n",
      "was in; and I was kinder stunned; everything was going so different from\n",
      "what I had allowed for; stead of being fixed so I could take my own time\n",
      "if I wanted to, and see all the fun, and have Mary Jane at my back to\n",
      "save me and set me free when the close-fit come, here was nothing in the\n",
      "world betwixt me and sudden death but just them tattoo-marks.  If they\n",
      "didn't find them--\n",
      "\n",
      "I couldn't bear to think about it; and yet, somehow, I couldn't think\n",
      "about nothing else.  It got darker and darker, and it was a beautiful\n",
      "time to give the crowd the slip; but that big husky had me by the\n",
      "wrist--Hines--and a body might as well try to give Goliar the slip.  He\n",
      "dragged me right along, he was so excited, and I had to run to keep up.\n",
      "\n",
      "When they got there they swarmed into the graveyard and washed over it\n",
      "like an overflow.  And when they got to the grave they found they had\n",
      "about a hundred times as many shovels as they wanted, but nobody hadn't\n",
      "thought to fetch a lantern.  But they sailed into digging anyway by the\n",
      "flicker of the lightning, and sent a man to the nearest house, a half a\n",
      "mile off, to borrow one.\n",
      "\n",
      "So they dug and dug like everything; and it got awful dark, and the rain\n",
      "started, and the wind swished and swushed along, and the lightning come\n",

      "and if she didn't, everybody naturally despises an ungrateful nigger,\n",
      "and they'd make Jim feel it all the time, and so he'd feel ornery and\n",
      "disgraced. And then think of _me_!  It would get all around that Huck\n",

      "then he don't want to take no consequences of it. Thinks as long as he\n",
      "can hide it, it ain't no disgrace.  That was my fix exactly. The more I\n",
      "studied about this the more my conscience went to grinding me, and the\n",
      "more wicked and low-down and ornery I got to feeling. And at last, when\n",
      "it hit me all of a sudden that here was the plain hand of Providence\n",
      "slapping me in the face and letting me know my wickedness was being\n",
      "watched all the time from up there in heaven, whilst I was stealing a\n",

      "to allow no such miserable doings to go only just so fur and no further,\n",
      "I most dropped in my tracks I was so scared.  Well, I tried the best I\n",
      "could to kinder soften it up somehow for myself by saying I was brung\n",
      "up wicked, and so I warn't so much to blame; but something inside of me\n",

      "if you'd a done it they'd a learnt you there that people that acts as\n",
      "I'd been acting about that nigger goes to everlasting fire.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "It made me shiver.  And I about made up my mind to pray, and see if I\n",
      "couldn't try to quit being the kind of a boy I was and be better.  So\n",
      "I kneeled down.  But the words wouldn't come.  Why wouldn't they?  It\n",
      "warn't no use to try and hide it from Him.  Nor from _me_, neither.  I\n",
      "knowed very well why they wouldn't come.  It was because my heart warn't\n",
      "right; it was because I warn't square; it was because I was playing\n",
      "double.  I was letting _on_ to give up sin, but away inside of me I was\n",
      "holding on to the biggest one of all.  I was trying to make my mouth\n",
      "_say_ I would do the right thing and the clean thing, and go and write\n",
      "to that nigger's owner and tell where he was; but deep down in me I\n",
      "knowed it was a lie, and He knowed it.  You can't pray a lie--I found\n",
      "that out.\n",
      "\n",
      "So I was full of trouble, full as I could be; and didn't know what to\n",
      "do. At last I had an idea; and I says, I'll go and write the letter--and\n",
      "then see if I can pray.  Why, it was astonishing, the way I felt as\n",
      "light as a feather right straight off, and my troubles all gone.  So I\n",
      "got a piece of paper and a pencil, all glad and excited, and set down\n",
      "and wrote:\n",
      "\n",
      "Miss Watson, your runaway nigger Jim is down here two mile below\n",
      "Pikesville, and Mr. Phelps has got him and he will give him up for the\n",

      "\n",
      "_Huck Finn._\n",
      "\n",
      "I felt good and all washed clean of sin for the first time I had ever\n",

      "straight off, but laid the paper down and set there thinking--thinking\n",
      "how good it was all this happened so, and how near I come to being lost\n",
      "and going to hell.  And went on thinking.  And got to thinking over our\n",
      "trip down the river; and I see Jim before me all the time:  in the day\n",
      "and in the night-time, sometimes moonlight, sometimes storms, and we\n",
      "a-floating along, talking and singing and laughing.  But somehow I\n",
      "couldn't seem to strike no places to harden me against him, but only the\n",
      "other kind.  I'd see him standing my watch on top of his'n, 'stead of\n",
      "calling me, so I could go on sleeping; and see him how glad he was when\n",
      "I come back out of the fog; and when I come to him again in the swamp,\n",
      "up there where the feud was; and such-like times; and would always call\n",
      "me honey, and pet me and do everything he could think of for me, and how\n",
      "good he always was; and at last I struck the time I saved him by telling\n",
      "the men we had small-pox aboard, and he was so grateful, and said I was\n",
      "the best friend old Jim ever had in the world, and the _only_ one he's\n",
      "got now; and then I happened to look around and see that paper.\n",
      "\n",
      "It was a close place.  I took it up, and held it in my hand.  I was\n",
      "a-trembling, because I'd got to decide, forever, betwixt two things, and\n",
      "I knowed it.  I studied a minute, sort of holding my breath, and then\n",
      "says to myself:\n",
      "\n",
      "\"All right, then, I'll _go_ to hell\"--and tore it up.\n",
      "\n",
      "It was awful thoughts and awful words, but they was said.  And I let\n",
      "them stay said; and never thought no more about reforming.  I shoved the\n",
      "whole thing out of my head, and said I would take up wickedness again,\n",
      "which was in my line, being brung up to it, and the other warn't.  And\n",
      "for a starter I would go to work and steal Jim out of slavery again;\n",
      "and if I could think up anything worse, I would do that, too; because as\n",
      "long as I was in, and in for good, I might as well go the whole hog.\n",
      "\n",
      "Then I set to thinking over how to get at it, and turned over some\n",
      "considerable many ways in my mind; and at last fixed up a plan that\n",
      "suited me.  So then I took the bearings of a woody island that was down\n",
      "the river a piece, and as soon as it was fairly dark I crept out with my\n",
      "raft and went for it, and hid it there, and then turned in.  I slept the\n",
      "night through, and got up before it was light, and had my breakfast,\n",
      "and put on my store clothes, and tied up some others and one thing or\n",
      "another in a bundle, and took the canoe and cleared for shore.  I landed\n",
      "below where I judged was Phelps's place, and hid my bundle in the woods,\n",
      "and then filled up the canoe with water, and loaded rocks into her and\n",
      "sunk her where I could find her again when I wanted her, about a quarter\n",
      "of a mile below a little steam sawmill that was on the bank.\n",
      "\n",
      "Then I struck up the road, and when I passed the mill I see a sign on\n",
      "it, \"Phelps's Sawmill,\" and when I come to the farm-houses, two or\n",
      "three hundred yards further along, I kept my eyes peeled, but didn't\n",
      "see nobody around, though it was good daylight now.  But I didn't mind,\n",
      "because I didn't want to see nobody just yet--I only wanted to get the\n",
      "lay of the land. According to my plan, I was going to turn up there from\n",
      "the village, not from below.  So I just took a look, and shoved along,\n",
      "straight for town. Well, the very first man I see when I got there was\n",
      "the duke.  He was sticking up a bill for the Royal Nonesuch--three-night\n",
      "performance--like that other time.  They had the cheek, them frauds!  I\n",
      "was right on him before I could shirk.  He looked astonished, and says:\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Hel-_lo_!  Where'd _you_ come from?\"  Then he says, kind of glad and\n",
      "eager, \"Where's the raft?--got her in a good place?\"\n",
      "\n",
      "I says:\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Why, that's just what I was going to ask your grace.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "Then he didn't look so joyful, and says:\n",
      "\n",
      "\"What was your idea for asking _me_?\" he says.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Well,\" I says, \"when I see the king in that doggery yesterday I says\n",
      "to myself, we can't get him home for hours, till he's soberer; so I went\n",
      "a-loafing around town to put in the time and wait.  A man up and offered\n",
      "me ten cents to help him pull a skiff over the river and back to fetch\n",
      "a sheep, and so I went along; but when we was dragging him to the boat,\n",
      "and the man left me a-holt of the rope and went behind him to shove him\n",
      "along, he was too strong for me and jerked loose and run, and we after\n",
      "him.  We didn't have no dog, and so we had to chase him all over the\n",
      "country till we tired him out.  We never got him till dark; then we\n",
      "fetched him over, and I started down for the raft.  When I got there and\n",
      "see it was gone, I says to myself, 'They've got into trouble and had to\n",
      "leave; and they've took my nigger, which is the only nigger I've got in\n",
      "the world, and now I'm in a strange country, and ain't got no property\n",
      "no more, nor nothing, and no way to make my living;' so I set down and\n",
      "cried.  I slept in the woods all night.  But what _did_ become of the\n",
      "raft, then?--and Jim--poor Jim!\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Blamed if I know--that is, what's become of the raft.  That old fool had\n",
      "made a trade and got forty dollars, and when we found him in the doggery\n",
      "the loafers had matched half-dollars with him and got every cent but\n",
      "what he'd spent for whisky; and when I got him home late last night and\n",
      "found the raft gone, we said, 'That little rascal has stole our raft and\n",
      "shook us, and run off down the river.'\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"I wouldn't shake my _nigger_, would I?--the only nigger I had in the\n",
      "world, and the only property.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"We never thought of that.  Fact is, I reckon we'd come to consider him\n",
      "_our_ nigger; yes, we did consider him so--goodness knows we had trouble\n",
      "enough for him.  So when we see the raft was gone and we flat broke,\n",
      "there warn't anything for it but to try the Royal Nonesuch another\n",
      "shake. And I've pegged along ever since, dry as a powder-horn.  Where's\n",
      "that ten cents? Give it here.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "I had considerable money, so I give him ten cents, but begged him to\n",
      "spend it for something to eat, and give me some, because it was all the\n",
      "money I had, and I hadn't had nothing to eat since yesterday.  He never\n",
      "said nothing.  The next minute he whirls on me and says:\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Do you reckon that nigger would blow on us?  We'd skin him if he done\n",
      "that!\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"How can he blow?  Hain't he run off?\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"No!  That old fool sold him, and never divided with me, and the money's\n",
      "gone.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"_Sold_ him?\"  I says, and begun to cry; \"why, he was _my_ nigger, and\n",
      "that was my money.  Where is he?--I want my nigger.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Well, you can't _get_ your nigger, that's all--so dry up your\n",
      "blubbering. Looky here--do you think _you'd_ venture to blow on us?\n",
      " Blamed if I think I'd trust you.  Why, if you _was_ to blow on us--\"\n",
      "\n",
      "He stopped, but I never see the duke look so ugly out of his eyes\n",
      "before. I went on a-whimpering, and says:\n",
      "\n",
      "\"I don't want to blow on nobody; and I ain't got no time to blow, nohow.\n",
      "I got to turn out and find my nigger.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "He looked kinder bothered, and stood there with his bills fluttering on\n",
      "his arm, thinking, and wrinkling up his forehead.  At last he says:\n",
      "\n",
      "\"I'll tell you something.  We got to be here three days.  If you'll\n",
      "promise you won't blow, and won't let the nigger blow, I'll tell you\n",
      "where to find him.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "So I promised, and he says:\n",
      "\n",
      "\"A farmer by the name of Silas Ph--\" and then he stopped.  You see, he\n",
      "started to tell me the truth; but when he stopped that way, and begun to\n",
      "study and think again, I reckoned he was changing his mind.  And so he\n",
      "was. He wouldn't trust me; he wanted to make sure of having me out of\n",
      "the way the whole three days.  So pretty soon he says:\n",
      "\n",
      "\"The man that bought him is named Abram Foster--Abram G. Foster--and he\n",
      "lives forty mile back here in the country, on the road to Lafayette.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"All right,\" I says, \"I can walk it in three days.  And I'll start this\n",
      "very afternoon.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"No you wont, you'll start _now_; and don't you lose any time about it,\n",
      "neither, nor do any gabbling by the way.  Just keep a tight tongue in\n",
      "your head and move right along, and then you won't get into trouble with\n",
      "_us_, d'ye hear?\"\n",
      "\n",
      "That was the order I wanted, and that was the one I played for.  I\n",
      "wanted to be left free to work my plans.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"So clear out,\" he says; \"and you can tell Mr. Foster whatever you want\n",
      "to. Maybe you can get him to believe that Jim _is_ your nigger--some\n",
      "idiots don't require documents--leastways I've heard there's such down\n",
      "South here.  And when you tell him the handbill and the reward's bogus,\n",
      "maybe he'll believe you when you explain to him what the idea was for\n",
      "getting 'em out.  Go 'long now, and tell him anything you want to; but\n",
      "mind you don't work your jaw any _between_ here and there.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "So I left, and struck for the back country.  I didn't look around, but I\n",
      "kinder felt like he was watching me.  But I knowed I could tire him out\n",
      "at that.  I went straight out in the country as much as a mile before\n",
      "I stopped; then I doubled back through the woods towards Phelps'.  I\n",
      "reckoned I better start in on my plan straight off without fooling\n",
      "around, because I wanted to stop Jim's mouth till these fellows could\n",
      "get away.  I didn't want no trouble with their kind.  I'd seen all I\n",

      "in a cupboard in a damp cellar all night and tastes like a hunk of\n",
      "old cold cannibal in the morning.  Uncle Silas he asked a pretty long\n",
      "blessing over it, but it was worth it; and it didn't cool it a bit,\n",
      "neither, the way I've seen them kind of interruptions do lots of times.\n",

      "all over tar and feathers, and didn't look like nothing in the\n",
      "world that was human--just looked like a couple of monstrous big\n",

      "We see we was too late--couldn't do no good.  We asked some stragglers\n",

      "middle of his cavortings on the stage; then somebody give a signal, and\n",

      " There ain't no hurry; le's keep on looking around.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "Betwixt the hut and the fence, on the back side, was a lean-to that\n",
      "joined the hut at the eaves, and was made out of plank.  It was as long\n",
      "as the hut, but narrow--only about six foot wide.  The door to it was at\n",
      "the south end, and was padlocked.  Tom he went to the soap-kettle and\n",
      "searched around, and fetched back the iron thing they lift the lid with;\n",
      "so he took it and prized out one of the staples.  The chain fell down,\n",
      "and we opened the door and went in, and shut it, and struck a match,\n",
      "and see the shed was only built against a cabin and hadn't no connection\n",
      "with it; and there warn't no floor to the shed, nor nothing in it but\n",
      "some old rusty played-out hoes and spades and picks and a crippled plow.\n",
      " The match went out, and so did we, and shoved in the staple again, and\n",
      "the door was locked as good as ever. Tom was joyful.  He says;\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Now we're all right.  We'll _dig_ him out.  It 'll take about a week!\"\n",
      "\n",

      "to pull a buckskin latch-string, they don't fasten the doors--but that\n",
      "warn't romantical enough for Tom Sawyer; no way would do him but he must\n",
      "climb up the lightning-rod.  But after he got up half way about three\n",
      "times, and missed fire and fell every time, and the last time most\n",
      "busted his brains out, he thought he'd got to give it up; but after he\n",

      "time he made the trip.\n",
      "\n",
      "In the morning we was up at break of day, and down to the nigger cabins\n",

      "\n",
      "This nigger had a good-natured, chuckle-headed face, and his wool was\n",
      "all tied up in little bunches with thread.  That was to keep witches\n",
      "off.  He said the witches was pestering him awful these nights, and\n",
      "making him see all kinds of strange things, and hear all kinds of\n",
      "strange words and noises, and he didn't believe he was ever witched so\n",
      "long before in his life.  He got so worked up, and got to running on so\n",
      "about his troubles, he forgot all about what he'd been a-going to do.\n",

      "\n",
      "\"Well, that's mighty curious.  _Who_ sung out? _when_ did he sing out?\n",
      " _what_ did he sing out?\" And turns to me, perfectly ca'm, and says,\n",
      "\"Did _you_ hear anybody sing out?\"\n",

      "Of course there warn't nothing to be said but the one thing; so I says:\n",
      "\n",
      "\"No; I ain't heard nobody say nothing.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "Then he turns to Jim, and looks him over like he never see him before,\n",

      "\"Did you sing out?\"\n",

      "and a body ain't got no business doing wrong when he ain't ignorant and\n",
      "knows better.  It might answer for _you_ to dig Jim out with a pick,\n",
      "_without_ any letting on, because you don't know no better; but it\n",

      "\n",
      "I didn't know just what to do--but then I thought.  I scratched around\n",

      "\n",
      "He was always just that particular.  Full of principle.\n",
      "\n",
      "So then I got a shovel, and then we picked and shoveled, turn about,\n",
      "and made the fur fly.  We stuck to it about a half an hour, which was as\n",
      "long as we could stand up; but we had a good deal of a hole to show for\n",
      "it. When I got up stairs I looked out at the window and see Tom doing\n",
      "his level best with the lightning-rod, but he couldn't come it, his\n",
      "hands was so sore.  At last he says:\n",
      "\n",

      "\n",
      "Next day Tom stole a pewter spoon and a brass candlestick in the house,\n",
      "for to make some pens for Jim out of, and six tallow candles; and I\n",
      "hung around the nigger cabins and laid for a chance, and stole three tin\n",
      "plates.  Tom says it wasn't enough; but I said nobody wouldn't ever see\n",
      "the plates that Jim throwed out, because they'd fall in the dog-fennel\n",
      "and jimpson weeds under the window-hole--then we could tote them back and\n",
      "he could use them over again.  So Tom was satisfied.  Then he says:\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Now, the thing to study out is, how to get the things to Jim.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Take them in through the hole,\" I says, \"when we get it done.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "He only just looked scornful, and said something about nobody ever heard\n",
      "of such an idiotic idea, and then he went to studying.  By and by he\n",
      "said he had ciphered out two or three ways, but there warn't no need to\n",
      "decide on any of them yet.  Said we'd got to post Jim first.\n",
      "\n",
      "That night we went down the lightning-rod a little after ten, and took\n",
      "one of the candles along, and listened under the window-hole, and heard\n",
      "Jim snoring; so we pitched it in, and it didn't wake him.  Then we\n",
      "whirled in with the pick and shovel, and in about two hours and a half\n",
      "the job was done.  We crept in under Jim's bed and into the cabin, and\n",
      "pawed around and found the candle and lit it, and stood over Jim awhile,\n",
      "and found him looking hearty and healthy, and then we woke him up gentle\n",
      "and gradual.  He was so glad to see us he most cried; and called us\n",
      "honey, and all the pet names he could think of; and was for having us\n",
      "hunt up a cold-chisel to cut the chain off of his leg with right away,\n",
      "and clearing out without losing any time.  But Tom he showed him how\n",
      "unregular it would be, and set down and told him all about our plans,\n",
      "and how we could alter them in a minute any time there was an alarm; and\n",
      "not to be the least afraid, because we would see he got away, _sure_.\n",
      " So Jim he said it was all right, and we set there and talked over old\n",
      "times awhile, and then Tom asked a lot of questions, and when Jim told\n",
      "him Uncle Silas come in every day or two to pray with him, and Aunt\n",
      "Sally come in to see if he was comfortable and had plenty to eat, and\n",
      "both of them was kind as they could be, Tom says:\n",
      "\n",
      "\"_Now_ I know how to fix it.  We'll send you some things by them.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "I said, \"Don't do nothing of the kind; it's one of the most jackass\n",
      "ideas I ever struck;\" but he never paid no attention to me; went right\n",
      "on.  It was his way when he'd got his plans set.\n",
      "\n",
      "So he told Jim how we'd have to smuggle in the rope-ladder pie and other\n",
      "large things by Nat, the nigger that fed him, and he must be on the\n",
      "lookout, and not be surprised, and not let Nat see him open them; and\n",
      "we would put small things in uncle's coat-pockets and he must steal them\n",
      "out; and we would tie things to aunt's apron-strings or put them in her\n",
      "apron-pocket, if we got a chance; and told him what they would be and\n",
      "what they was for.  And told him how to keep a journal on the shirt with\n",
      "his blood, and all that. He told him everything.  Jim he couldn't see\n",
      "no sense in the most of it, but he allowed we was white folks and knowed\n",
      "better than him; so he was satisfied, and said he would do it all just\n",
      "as Tom said.\n",
      "\n",
      "Jim had plenty corn-cob pipes and tobacco; so we had a right down good\n",
      "sociable time; then we crawled out through the hole, and so home to\n",
      "bed, with hands that looked like they'd been chawed.  Tom was in high\n",
      "spirits. He said it was the best fun he ever had in his life, and the\n",
      "most intellectural; and said if he only could see his way to it we would\n",
      "keep it up all the rest of our lives and leave Jim to our children to\n",
      "get out; for he believed Jim would come to like it better and better the\n",
      "more he got used to it.  He said that in that way it could be strung out\n",
      "to as much as eighty year, and would be the best time on record.  And he\n",
      "said it would make us all celebrated that had a hand in it.\n",
      "\n",
      "In the morning we went out to the woodpile and chopped up the brass\n",
      "candlestick into handy sizes, and Tom put them and the pewter spoon in\n",
      "his pocket.  Then we went to the nigger cabins, and while I got Nat's\n",
      "notice off, Tom shoved a piece of candlestick into the middle of a\n",
      "corn-pone that was in Jim's pan, and we went along with Nat to see how\n",
      "it would work, and it just worked noble; when Jim bit into it it most\n",
      "mashed all his teeth out; and there warn't ever anything could a worked\n",
      "better. Tom said so himself. Jim he never let on but what it was only\n",
      "just a piece of rock or something like that that's always getting into\n",
      "bread, you know; but after that he never bit into nothing but what he\n",

      "\n",
      "And whilst we was a-standing there in the dimmish light, here comes a\n",

      "piling in till there was eleven of them, and there warn't hardly room\n",
      "in there to get your breath.  By jings, we forgot to fasten that lean-to\n",
      "door!  The nigger Nat he only just hollered \"Witches\" once, and keeled\n",
      "over on to the floor amongst the dogs, and begun to groan like he was\n",
      "dying.  Tom jerked the door open and flung out a slab of Jim's meat,\n",
      "and the dogs went for it, and in two seconds he was out himself and back\n",
      "again and shut the door, and I knowed he'd fixed the other door too.\n",
      "Then he went to work on the nigger, coaxing him and petting him, and\n",

      "and the spiders didn't like Jim; and so they'd lay for him, and make it\n",

      "when there was, a body couldn't sleep, it was so lively, and it was\n",

      "and Tom stopped us there and put his eye to the crack, but couldn't make\n",
      "out nothing, it was so dark; and whispered and said he would listen\n",
      "for the steps to get further, and when he nudged us Jim must glide out\n",
      "first, and him last.  So he set his ear to the crack and listened, and\n",
      "listened, and listened, and the steps a-scraping around out there all\n",
      "the time; and at last he nudged us, and we slid out, and stooped down,\n",
      "not breathing, and not making the least noise, and slipped stealthy\n",
      "towards the fence in Injun file, and got to it all right, and me and Jim\n",
      "over it; but Tom's britches catched fast on a splinter on the top\n",
      "rail, and then he hear the steps coming, so he had to pull loose, which\n",
      "snapped the splinter and made a noise; and as he dropped in our tracks\n",

      "\n",
      "\"Who's that?  Answer, or I'll shoot!\"\n",
      "\n",
      "But we didn't answer; we just unfurled our heels and shoved.  Then there\n",

      "in the path to the mill; and when they got pretty close on to us we\n",
      "dodged into the bush and let them go by, and then dropped in behind\n",
      "them.  They'd had all the dogs shut up, so they wouldn't scare off the\n",
      "robbers; but by this time somebody had let them loose, and here they\n",

      "nobody but us, and no excitement to offer them, they only just said\n",
      "howdy, and tore right ahead towards the shouting and clattering; and\n",
      "then we up-steam again, and whizzed along after them till we was nearly\n",
      "to the mill, and then struck up through the bush to where my canoe was\n",
      "tied, and hopped in and pulled for dear life towards the middle of the\n",
      "river, but didn't make no more noise than we was obleeged to. Then we\n",

      "we could hear them yelling and barking at each other all up and down the\n",

      " He raised considerable row about it, but me and Jim stuck to it and\n",
      "wouldn't budge; so he was for crawling out and setting the raft loose\n",
      "himself; but we wouldn't let him.  Then he give us a piece of his mind,\n",

      "full of gold in his hand, and then take and lead him all around the\n",

      "\n",

      "\n",
      "THE doctor was an old man; a very nice, kind-looking old man when I got\n",
      "him up.  I told him me and my brother was over on Spanish Island hunting\n",
      "yesterday afternoon, and camped on a piece of a raft we found, and about\n",
      "midnight he must a kicked his gun in his dreams, for it went off and\n",
      "shot him in the leg, and we wanted him to go over there and fix it and\n",
      "not say nothing about it, nor let anybody know, because we wanted to\n",
      "come home this evening and surprise the folks.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Who is your folks?\" he says.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"The Phelpses, down yonder.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Oh,\" he says.  And after a minute, he says:\n",

      "So he lit up his lantern, and got his saddle-bags, and we started.  But\n",
      "when he sees the canoe he didn't like the look of her--said she was big\n",
      "enough for one, but didn't look pretty safe for two.  I says:\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Oh, you needn't be afeard, sir, she carried the three of us easy\n",

      "But he put his foot on the gunnel and rocked her, and shook his head,\n",
      "and said he reckoned he'd look around for a bigger one.  But they was\n",
      "all locked and chained; so he took my canoe, and said for me to wait\n",
      "till he come back, or I could hunt around further, or maybe I better\n",
      "go down home and get them ready for the surprise if I wanted to.  But\n",
      "I said I didn't; so I told him just how to find the raft, and then he\n",
      "started.\n",
      "\n",
      "I struck an idea pretty soon.  I says to myself, spos'n he can't fix\n",

      "spos'n it takes him three or four days?  What are we going to do?--lay\n",
      "around there till he lets the cat out of the bag?  No, sir; I know what\n",
      "_I'll_ do.  I'll wait, and when he comes back if he says he's got to\n",
      "go any more I'll get down there, too, if I swim; and we'll take and tie\n",
      "him, and keep him, and shove out down the river; and when Tom's done\n",
      "with him we'll give him what it's worth, or all we got, and then let him\n",
      "get ashore.\n",
      "\n",
      "So then I crept into a lumber-pile to get some sleep; and next time I\n",

      "or other, and warn't back yet.  Well, thinks I, that looks powerful bad\n",
      "for Tom, and I'll dig out for the island right off.  So away I shoved,\n",

      "crossed over, but couldn't find nothing of them; so we cruised along\n",
      "up-shore till we got kind of tired and beat out; and tied up the canoe\n",
      "and went to sleep, and never waked up till about an hour ago; then we\n",
      "paddled over here to hear the news, and Sid's at the post-office to see\n",

      "\n",
      "So then we went to the post-office to get \"Sid\"; but just as I\n",
      "suspicioned, he warn't there; so the old man he got a letter out of the\n",

      "said, come along, let Sid foot it home, or canoe it, when he got done\n",

      "heavy, or could have meat and greens with his bread and water; but they\n",
      "didn't think of it, and I reckoned it warn't best for me to mix in, but\n",

      "in, and there I was, up a stump again!  She motioned me to be still, and\n",
      "set down by me, and begun to whisper, and said we could all be joyful\n",
      "now, because all the symptoms was first-rate, and he'd been sleeping\n",

      "YOU don't know about me without you have read a book by the name of The\n",
      "Adventures of Tom Sawyer; but that ain't no matter.  That book was made\n",
      "by Mr. Mark Twain, and he told the truth, mainly.  There was things\n",
      "which he stretched, but mainly he told the truth.  That is nothing.  I\n",
      "never seen anybody but lied one time or another, without it was Aunt\n",
      "Polly, or the widow, or maybe Mary.  Aunt Polly--Tom's Aunt Polly, she\n",
      "is--and Mary, and the Widow Douglas is all told about in that book, which\n",
      "is mostly a true book, with some stretchers, as I said before.\n",
      "\n",
      "Now the way that the book winds up is this:  Tom and me found the money\n",
      "that the robbers hid in the cave, and it made us rich.  We got six\n",
      "thousand dollars apiece--all gold.  It was an awful sight of money when\n",
      "it was piled up.  Well, Judge Thatcher he took it and put it out\n",
      "at interest, and it fetched us a dollar a day apiece all the year\n",
      "round--more than a body could tell what to do with.  The Widow Douglas\n",
      "she took me for her son, and allowed she would sivilize me; but it was\n",
      "rough living in the house all the time, considering how dismal regular\n",
      "and decent the widow was in all her ways; and so when I couldn't stand\n",
      "it no longer I lit out.  I got into my old rags and my sugar-hogshead\n",
      "again, and was free and satisfied.  But Tom Sawyer he hunted me up and\n",
      "said he was going to start a band of robbers, and I might join if I\n",
      "would go back to the widow and be respectable.  So I went back.\n",
      "\n",
      "The widow she cried over me, and called me a poor lost lamb, and she\n",
      "called me a lot of other names, too, but she never meant no harm by\n",
      "it. She put me in them new clothes again, and I couldn't do nothing but\n",
      "sweat and sweat, and feel all cramped up.  Well, then, the old thing\n",
      "commenced again.  The widow rung a bell for supper, and you had to come\n",
      "to time. When you got to the table you couldn't go right to eating, but\n",
      "you had to wait for the widow to tuck down her head and grumble a little\n",
      "over the victuals, though there warn't really anything the matter with\n",
      "them,--that is, nothing only everything was cooked by itself.  In a\n",
      "barrel of odds and ends it is different; things get mixed up, and the\n",
      "juice kind of swaps around, and the things go better.\n",
      "\n",
      "After supper she got out her book and learned me about Moses and the\n",
      "Bulrushers, and I was in a sweat to find out all about him; but by and\n",
      "by she let it out that Moses had been dead a considerable long time; so\n",
      "then I didn't care no more about him, because I don't take no stock in\n",
      "dead people.\n",
      "\n",
      "Pretty soon I wanted to smoke, and asked the widow to let me.  But she\n",
      "wouldn't.  She said it was a mean practice and wasn't clean, and I must\n",
      "try to not do it any more.  That is just the way with some people.  They\n",
      "get down on a thing when they don't know nothing about it.  Here she was\n",
      "a-bothering about Moses, which was no kin to her, and no use to anybody,\n",
      "being gone, you see, yet finding a power of fault with me for doing a\n",
      "thing that had some good in it.  And she took snuff, too; of course that\n",
      "was all right, because she done it herself.\n",
      "\n",
      "Her sister, Miss Watson, a tolerable slim old maid, with goggles on,\n",
      "had just come to live with her, and took a set at me now with a\n",
      "spelling-book. She worked me middling hard for about an hour, and then\n",
      "the widow made her ease up.  I couldn't stood it much longer.  Then for\n",
      "an hour it was deadly dull, and I was fidgety.  Miss Watson would say,\n",
      "\"Don't put your feet up there, Huckleberry;\" and \"Don't scrunch up\n",
      "like that, Huckleberry--set up straight;\" and pretty soon she would\n",
      "say, \"Don't gap and stretch like that, Huckleberry--why don't you try to\n",
      "behave?\"  Then she told me all about the bad place, and I said I wished\n",
      "I was there. She got mad then, but I didn't mean no harm.  All I wanted\n",
      "was to go somewheres; all I wanted was a change, I warn't particular.\n",
      " She said it was wicked to say what I said; said she wouldn't say it for\n",
      "the whole world; she was going to live so as to go to the good place.\n",
      " Well, I couldn't see no advantage in going where she was going, so I\n",
      "made up my mind I wouldn't try for it.  But I never said so, because it\n",
      "would only make trouble, and wouldn't do no good.\n",
      "\n",
      "Now she had got a start, and she went on and told me all about the good\n",
      "place.  She said all a body would have to do there was to go around all\n",
      "day long with a harp and sing, forever and ever.  So I didn't think\n",
      "much of it. But I never said so.  I asked her if she reckoned Tom Sawyer\n",
      "would go there, and she said not by a considerable sight.  I was glad\n",
      "about that, because I wanted him and me to be together.\n",
      "\n",
      "Miss Watson she kept pecking at me, and it got tiresome and lonesome.\n",
      " By and by they fetched the niggers in and had prayers, and then\n",
      "everybody was off to bed.  I went up to my room with a piece of candle,\n",
      "and put it on the table.  Then I set down in a chair by the window and\n",
      "tried to think of something cheerful, but it warn't no use.  I felt\n",
      "so lonesome I most wished I was dead.  The stars were shining, and the\n",
      "leaves rustled in the woods ever so mournful; and I heard an owl, away\n",
      "off, who-whooing about somebody that was dead, and a whippowill and a\n",
      "dog crying about somebody that was going to die; and the wind was trying\n",
      "to whisper something to me, and I couldn't make out what it was, and so\n",
      "it made the cold shivers run over me. Then away out in the woods I heard\n",
      "that kind of a sound that a ghost makes when it wants to tell about\n",
      "something that's on its mind and can't make itself understood, and so\n",
      "can't rest easy in its grave, and has to go about that way every night\n",
      "grieving.  I got so down-hearted and scared I did wish I had some\n",
      "company.  Pretty soon a spider went crawling up my shoulder, and I\n",
      "flipped it off and it lit in the candle; and before I could budge it\n",
      "was all shriveled up.  I didn't need anybody to tell me that that was\n",
      "an awful bad sign and would fetch me some bad luck, so I was scared\n",
      "and most shook the clothes off of me. I got up and turned around in my\n",
      "tracks three times and crossed my breast every time; and then I tied\n",
      "up a little lock of my hair with a thread to keep witches away.  But\n",
      "I hadn't no confidence.  You do that when you've lost a horseshoe that\n",
      "you've found, instead of nailing it up over the door, but I hadn't ever\n",
      "heard anybody say it was any way to keep off bad luck when you'd killed\n",
      "a spider.\n",
      "\n",
      "I set down again, a-shaking all over, and got out my pipe for a smoke;\n",
      "for the house was all as still as death now, and so the widow wouldn't\n",
      "know. Well, after a long time I heard the clock away off in the town\n",
      "go boom--boom--boom--twelve licks; and all still again--stiller than\n",
      "ever. Pretty soon I heard a twig snap down in the dark amongst the\n",
      "trees--something was a stirring.  I set still and listened.  Directly I\n",
      "could just barely hear a \"me-yow! me-yow!\" down there.  That was good!\n",
      " Says I, \"me-yow! me-yow!\" as soft as I could, and then I put out the\n",
      "light and scrambled out of the window on to the shed.  Then I slipped\n",
      "down to the ground and crawled in among the trees, and, sure enough,\n",
      "there was Tom Sawyer waiting for me.\n",

      "\n",

      "CHAPTER II.\n",
      "\n",
      "WE went tiptoeing along a path amongst the trees back towards the end of\n",
      "the widow's garden, stooping down so as the branches wouldn't scrape our\n",
      "heads. When we was passing by the kitchen I fell over a root and made\n",
      "a noise.  We scrouched down and laid still.  Miss Watson's big nigger,\n",
      "named Jim, was setting in the kitchen door; we could see him pretty\n",
      "clear, because there was a light behind him.  He got up and stretched\n",
      "his neck out about a minute, listening.  Then he says:\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Who dah?\"\n",
      "\n",
      "He listened some more; then he come tiptoeing down and stood right\n",
      "between us; we could a touched him, nearly.  Well, likely it was\n",
      "minutes and minutes that there warn't a sound, and we all there so close\n",
      "together.  There was a place on my ankle that got to itching, but I\n",
      "dasn't scratch it; and then my ear begun to itch; and next my back,\n",
      "right between my shoulders.  Seemed like I'd die if I couldn't scratch.\n",
      " Well, I've noticed that thing plenty times since.  If you are with\n",
      "the quality, or at a funeral, or trying to go to sleep when you ain't\n",
      "sleepy--if you are anywheres where it won't do for you to scratch, why\n",
      "you will itch all over in upwards of a thousand places. Pretty soon Jim\n",
      "says:\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Say, who is you?  Whar is you?  Dog my cats ef I didn' hear sumf'n.\n",
      "Well, I know what I's gwyne to do:  I's gwyne to set down here and\n",
      "listen tell I hears it agin.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "So he set down on the ground betwixt me and Tom.  He leaned his back up\n",
      "against a tree, and stretched his legs out till one of them most touched\n",
      "one of mine.  My nose begun to itch.  It itched till the tears come into\n",
      "my eyes.  But I dasn't scratch.  Then it begun to itch on the inside.\n",
      "Next I got to itching underneath.  I didn't know how I was going to set\n",
      "still. This miserableness went on as much as six or seven minutes; but\n",
      "it seemed a sight longer than that.  I was itching in eleven different\n",
      "places now.  I reckoned I couldn't stand it more'n a minute longer,\n",
      "but I set my teeth hard and got ready to try.  Just then Jim begun\n",
      "to breathe heavy; next he begun to snore--and then I was pretty soon\n",
      "comfortable again.\n",
      "\n",
      "Tom he made a sign to me--kind of a little noise with his mouth--and we\n",
      "went creeping away on our hands and knees.  When we was ten foot off Tom\n",
      "whispered to me, and wanted to tie Jim to the tree for fun.  But I said\n",
      "no; he might wake and make a disturbance, and then they'd find out I\n",
      "warn't in. Then Tom said he hadn't got candles enough, and he would slip\n",
      "in the kitchen and get some more.  I didn't want him to try.  I said Jim\n",
      "might wake up and come.  But Tom wanted to resk it; so we slid in there\n",
      "and got three candles, and Tom laid five cents on the table for pay.\n",
      "Then we got out, and I was in a sweat to get away; but nothing would do\n",
      "Tom but he must crawl to where Jim was, on his hands and knees, and play\n",
      "something on him.  I waited, and it seemed a good while, everything was\n",
      "so still and lonesome.\n",
      "\n",
      "As soon as Tom was back we cut along the path, around the garden fence,\n",
      "and by and by fetched up on the steep top of the hill the other side of\n",
      "the house.  Tom said he slipped Jim's hat off of his head and hung it\n",
      "on a limb right over him, and Jim stirred a little, but he didn't wake.\n",
      "Afterwards Jim said the witches be witched him and put him in a trance,\n",
      "and rode him all over the State, and then set him under the trees again,\n",
      "and hung his hat on a limb to show who done it.  And next time Jim told\n",
      "it he said they rode him down to New Orleans; and, after that, every\n",
      "time he told it he spread it more and more, till by and by he said they\n",
      "rode him all over the world, and tired him most to death, and his back\n",
      "was all over saddle-boils.  Jim was monstrous proud about it, and he\n",
      "got so he wouldn't hardly notice the other niggers.  Niggers would come\n",
      "miles to hear Jim tell about it, and he was more looked up to than any\n",
      "nigger in that country.  Strange niggers would stand with their mouths\n",
      "open and look him all over, same as if he was a wonder.  Niggers is\n",
      "always talking about witches in the dark by the kitchen fire; but\n",
      "whenever one was talking and letting on to know all about such things,\n",
      "Jim would happen in and say, \"Hm!  What you know 'bout witches?\" and\n",
      "that nigger was corked up and had to take a back seat.  Jim always kept\n",
      "that five-center piece round his neck with a string, and said it was a\n",
      "charm the devil give to him with his own hands, and told him he could\n",
      "cure anybody with it and fetch witches whenever he wanted to just by\n",
      "saying something to it; but he never told what it was he said to it.\n",
      " Niggers would come from all around there and give Jim anything they\n",
      "had, just for a sight of that five-center piece; but they wouldn't touch\n",
      "it, because the devil had had his hands on it.  Jim was most ruined for\n",
      "a servant, because he got stuck up on account of having seen the devil\n",
      "and been rode by witches.\n",
      "\n",
      "Well, when Tom and me got to the edge of the hilltop we looked away down\n",
      "into the village and could see three or four lights twinkling, where\n",
      "there was sick folks, maybe; and the stars over us was sparkling ever\n",
      "so fine; and down by the village was the river, a whole mile broad, and\n",
      "awful still and grand.  We went down the hill and found Jo Harper and\n",
      "Ben Rogers, and two or three more of the boys, hid in the old tanyard.\n",
      " So we unhitched a skiff and pulled down the river two mile and a half,\n",
      "to the big scar on the hillside, and went ashore.\n",
      "\n",
      "We went to a clump of bushes, and Tom made everybody swear to keep the\n",
      "secret, and then showed them a hole in the hill, right in the thickest\n",
      "part of the bushes.  Then we lit the candles, and crawled in on our\n",
      "hands and knees.  We went about two hundred yards, and then the cave\n",
      "opened up. Tom poked about amongst the passages, and pretty soon ducked\n",
      "under a wall where you wouldn't a noticed that there was a hole.  We\n",
      "went along a narrow place and got into a kind of room, all damp and\n",
      "sweaty and cold, and there we stopped.  Tom says:\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Now, we'll start this band of robbers and call it Tom Sawyer's Gang.\n",
      "Everybody that wants to join has got to take an oath, and write his name\n",
      "in blood.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "Everybody was willing.  So Tom got out a sheet of paper that he had\n",
      "wrote the oath on, and read it.  It swore every boy to stick to the\n",
      "band, and never tell any of the secrets; and if anybody done anything to\n",
      "any boy in the band, whichever boy was ordered to kill that person and\n",
      "his family must do it, and he mustn't eat and he mustn't sleep till he\n",
      "had killed them and hacked a cross in their breasts, which was the sign\n",
      "of the band. And nobody that didn't belong to the band could use that\n",
      "mark, and if he did he must be sued; and if he done it again he must be\n",
      "killed.  And if anybody that belonged to the band told the secrets, he\n",
      "must have his throat cut, and then have his carcass burnt up and the\n",

      "said every boy must have a family or somebody to kill, or else it\n",
      "wouldn't be fair and square for the others.  Well, nobody could think of\n",
      "anything to do--everybody was stumped, and set still.  I was most ready\n",
      "to cry; but all at once I thought of a way, and so I offered them Miss\n",
      "Watson--they could kill her.  Everybody said:\n",

      "\"Oh, she'll do.  That's all right.  Huck can come in.\"\n",

      "\n",
      "\"Oh, certainly.  It's best.  Some authorities think different, but\n",

      "\n",
      "\"Because it ain't in the books so--that's why.  Now, Ben Rogers, do you\n",

      "what she meant--I must help other people, and do everything I could for\n",
      "other people, and look out for them all the time, and never think about\n",
      "myself. This was including Miss Watson, as I took it.  I went out in the\n",

      "our swords and guns, and get ready.  He never could go after even a\n",
      "turnip-cart but he must have the swords and guns all scoured up for it,\n",

      "\n",
      " I didn't see no di'monds, and I told Tom Sawyer so.  He said there was\n",

      "and elephants and things.  I said, why couldn't we see them, then?  He\n",
      "said if I warn't so ignorant, but had read a book called Don Quixote, I\n",
      "would know without asking.  He said it was all done by enchantment.  He\n",

      " They don't think nothing of pulling a shot-tower up by the roots, and\n",

      "\n",
      "\"Well,\" says I, \"I think they are a pack of flat-heads for not keeping\n",

      "bucket and gourd; I took a dipper and a tin cup, and my old saw and two\n",
      "blankets, and the skillet and the coffee-pot.  I took fish-lines and\n",
      "matches and other things--everything that was worth a cent.  I cleaned\n",
      "out the place.  I wanted an axe, but there wasn't any, only the one out\n",
      "at the woodpile, and I knowed why I was going to leave that.  I fetched\n",

      "I had wore the ground a good deal crawling out of the hole and dragging\n",
      "out so many things.  So I fixed that as good as I could from the outside\n",
      "by scattering dust on the place, which covered up the smoothness and the\n",
      "sawdust.  Then I fixed the piece of log back into its place, and put two\n",
      "rocks under it and one against it to hold it there, for it was bent up\n",

      "and was hunting around for some birds when I see a wild pig; hogs soon\n",
      "went wild in them bottoms after they had got away from the prairie\n",

      "\n",
      "I took the axe and smashed in the door.  I beat it and hacked it\n",
      "considerable a-doing it.  I fetched the pig in, and took him back nearly\n",
      "to the table and hacked into his throat with the axe, and laid him down\n",
      "on the ground to bleed; I say ground because it was ground--hard packed,\n",
      "and no boards.  Well, next I took an old sack and put a lot of big rocks\n",
      "in it--all I could drag--and I started it from the pig, and dragged it to\n",
      "the door and through the woods down to the river and dumped it in, and\n",
      "down it sunk, out of sight.  You could easy see that something had been\n",
      "dragged over the ground.  I did wish Tom Sawyer was there; I knowed he\n",

      "touches.  Nobody could spread himself like Tom Sawyer in such a thing as\n",
      "that.\n",
      "\n",
      "Well, last I pulled out some of my hair, and blooded the axe good, and\n",
      "stuck it on the back side, and slung the axe in the corner.  Then I\n",
      "took up the pig and held him to my breast with my jacket (so he couldn't\n",
      "drip) till I got a good piece below the house and then dumped him into\n",
      "the river.  Now I thought of something else.  So I went and got the bag\n",
      "of meal and my old saw out of the canoe, and fetched them to the house.\n",
      " I took the bag to where it used to stand, and ripped a hole in the\n",
      "bottom of it with the saw, for there warn't no knives and forks on the\n",
      "place--pap done everything with his clasp-knife about the cooking.  Then\n",
      "I carried the sack about a hundred yards across the grass and through\n",
      "the willows east of the house, to a shallow lake that was five mile wide\n",
      "and full of rushes--and ducks too, you might say, in the season.  There\n",
      "was a slough or a creek leading out of it on the other side that went\n",
      "miles away, I don't know where, but it didn't go to the river.  The meal\n",
      "sifted out and made a little track all the way to the lake.  I dropped\n",
      "pap's whetstone there too, so as to look like it had been done by\n",
      "accident. Then I tied up the rip in the meal sack with a string, so it\n",
      "wouldn't leak no more, and took it and my saw to the canoe again.\n",
      "\n",
      "It was about dark now; so I dropped the canoe down the river under some\n",
      "willows that hung over the bank, and waited for the moon to rise.  I\n",
      "made fast to a willow; then I took a bite to eat, and by and by laid\n",
      "down in the canoe to smoke a pipe and lay out a plan.  I says to myself,\n",
      "they'll follow the track of that sackful of rocks to the shore and then\n",
      "drag the river for me.  And they'll follow that meal track to the lake\n",
      "and go browsing down the creek that leads out of it to find the robbers\n",
      "that killed me and took the things.  They won't ever hunt the river for\n",
      "anything but my dead carcass. They'll soon get tired of that, and won't\n",
      "bother no more about me.  All right; I can stop anywhere I want to.\n",
      "Jackson's Island is good enough for me; I know that island pretty well,\n",
      "and nobody ever comes there.  And then I can paddle over to town nights,\n",

      "I woke up I didn't know where I was for a minute.  I set up and looked\n",
      "around, a little scared.  Then I remembered.  The river looked miles and\n",
      "miles across.  The moon was so bright I could a counted the drift logs\n",
      "that went a-slipping along, black and still, hundreds of yards out from\n",
      "shore. Everything was dead quiet, and it looked late, and _smelt_ late.\n",
      "You know what I mean--I don't know the words to put it in.\n",
      "\n",
      "I took a good gap and a stretch, and was just going to unhitch and start\n",
      "when I heard a sound away over the water.  I listened.  Pretty soon I\n",
      "made it out.  It was that dull kind of a regular sound that comes from\n",
      "oars working in rowlocks when it's a still night.  I peeped out through\n",
      "the willow branches, and there it was--a skiff, away across the water.\n",
      " I couldn't tell how many was in it.  It kept a-coming, and when it was\n",
      "abreast of me I see there warn't but one man in it.  Think's I, maybe\n",
      "it's pap, though I warn't expecting him.  He dropped below me with the\n",
      "current, and by and by he came a-swinging up shore in the easy water,\n",
      "and he went by so close I could a reached out the gun and touched him.\n",
      " Well, it _was_ pap, sure enough--and sober, too, by the way he laid his\n",
      "oars.\n",
      "\n",
      "I didn't lose no time.  The next minute I was a-spinning down stream\n",
      "soft but quick in the shade of the bank.  I made two mile and a half,\n",
      "and then struck out a quarter of a mile or more towards the middle of\n",
      "the river, because pretty soon I would be passing the ferry landing, and\n",
      "people might see me and hail me.  I got out amongst the driftwood, and\n",
      "then laid down in the bottom of the canoe and let her float.\n",
      "\n",
      " I laid there, and had a good rest and a smoke out of my pipe, looking\n",
      "away into the sky; not a cloud in it.  The sky looks ever so deep when\n",
      "you lay down on your back in the moonshine; I never knowed it before.\n",
      " And how far a body can hear on the water such nights!  I heard people\n",
      "talking at the ferry landing. I heard what they said, too--every word\n",
      "of it.  One man said it was getting towards the long days and the short\n",
      "nights now.  T'other one said _this_ warn't one of the short ones, he\n",
      "reckoned--and then they laughed, and he said it over again, and they\n",
      "laughed again; then they waked up another fellow and told him, and\n",
      "laughed, but he didn't laugh; he ripped out something brisk, and said\n",
      "let him alone.  The first fellow said he 'lowed to tell it to his\n",
      "old woman--she would think it was pretty good; but he said that warn't\n",
      "nothing to some things he had said in his time. I heard one man say it\n",
      "was nearly three o'clock, and he hoped daylight wouldn't wait more than\n",
      "about a week longer.  After that the talk got further and further away,\n",
      "and I couldn't make out the words any more; but I could hear the mumble,\n",
      "and now and then a laugh, too, but it seemed a long ways off.\n",
      "\n",
      "I was away below the ferry now.  I rose up, and there was Jackson's\n",
      "Island, about two mile and a half down stream, heavy timbered and\n",
      "standing up out of the middle of the river, big and dark and solid, like\n",
      "a steamboat without any lights.  There warn't any signs of the bar at\n",
      "the head--it was all under water now.\n",
      "\n",
      "It didn't take me long to get there.  I shot past the head at a ripping\n",
      "rate, the current was so swift, and then I got into the dead water and\n",
      "landed on the side towards the Illinois shore.  I run the canoe into\n",
      "a deep dent in the bank that I knowed about; I had to part the willow\n",
      "branches to get in; and when I made fast nobody could a seen the canoe\n",
      "from the outside.\n",
      "\n",
      "I went up and set down on a log at the head of the island, and looked\n",
      "out on the big river and the black driftwood and away over to the town,\n",
      "three mile away, where there was three or four lights twinkling.  A\n",
      "monstrous big lumber-raft was about a mile up stream, coming along down,\n",
      "with a lantern in the middle of it.  I watched it come creeping down,\n",
      "and when it was most abreast of where I stood I heard a man say, \"Stern\n",
      "oars, there! heave her head to stabboard!\"  I heard that just as plain\n",
      "as if the man was by my side.\n",
      "\n",

      "CHAPTER VIII.\n",
      "\n",
      "THE sun was up so high when I waked that I judged it was after eight\n",
      "o'clock.  I laid there in the grass and the cool shade thinking about\n",
      "things, and feeling rested and ruther comfortable and satisfied.  I\n",
      "could see the sun out at one or two holes, but mostly it was big trees\n",
      "all about, and gloomy in there amongst them.  There was freckled places\n",
      "on the ground where the light sifted down through the leaves, and the\n",
      "freckled places swapped about a little, showing there was a little\n",
      "breeze up there.  A couple of squirrels set on a limb and jabbered at me\n",
      "very friendly.\n",
      "\n",
      "I was powerful lazy and comfortable--didn't want to get up and cook\n",
      "breakfast.  Well, I was dozing off again when I thinks I hears a deep\n",
      "sound of \"boom!\" away up the river.  I rouses up, and rests on my elbow\n",
      "and listens; pretty soon I hears it again.  I hopped up, and went and\n",
      "looked out at a hole in the leaves, and I see a bunch of smoke laying\n",
      "on the water a long ways up--about abreast the ferry.  And there was the\n",
      "ferryboat full of people floating along down.  I knowed what was the\n",
      "matter now.  \"Boom!\" I see the white smoke squirt out of the ferryboat's\n",
      "side.  You see, they was firing cannon over the water, trying to make my\n",
      "carcass come to the top.\n",
      "\n",
      "I was pretty hungry, but it warn't going to do for me to start a fire,\n",
      "because they might see the smoke.  So I set there and watched the\n",
      "cannon-smoke and listened to the boom.  The river was a mile wide there,\n",
      "and it always looks pretty on a summer morning--so I was having a good\n",
      "enough time seeing them hunt for my remainders if I only had a bite to\n",
      "eat. Well, then I happened to think how they always put quicksilver in\n",
      "loaves of bread and float them off, because they always go right to the\n",
      "drownded carcass and stop there.  So, says I, I'll keep a lookout, and\n",
      "if any of them's floating around after me I'll give them a show.  I\n",
      "changed to the Illinois edge of the island to see what luck I could\n",
      "have, and I warn't disappointed.  A big double loaf come along, and I\n",
      "most got it with a long stick, but my foot slipped and she floated out\n",
      "further.  Of course I was where the current set in the closest to the\n",
      "shore--I knowed enough for that.  But by and by along comes another one,\n",
      "and this time I won.  I took out the plug and shook out the little dab\n",
      "of quicksilver, and set my teeth in.  It was \"baker's bread\"--what the\n",
      "quality eat; none of your low-down corn-pone.\n",
      "\n",
      "I got a good place amongst the leaves, and set there on a log, munching\n",
      "the bread and watching the ferry-boat, and very well satisfied.  And\n",
      "then something struck me.  I says, now I reckon the widow or the parson\n",
      "or somebody prayed that this bread would find me, and here it has gone\n",
      "and done it.  So there ain't no doubt but there is something in that\n",
      "thing--that is, there's something in it when a body like the widow or the\n",
      "parson prays, but it don't work for me, and I reckon it don't work for\n",
      "only just the right kind.\n",
      "\n",
      "I lit a pipe and had a good long smoke, and went on watching.  The\n",
      "ferryboat was floating with the current, and I allowed I'd have a chance\n",
      "to see who was aboard when she come along, because she would come in\n",
      "close, where the bread did.  When she'd got pretty well along down\n",
      "towards me, I put out my pipe and went to where I fished out the bread,\n",
      "and laid down behind a log on the bank in a little open place.  Where\n",
      "the log forked I could peep through.\n",
      "\n",
      "By and by she come along, and she drifted in so close that they could\n",
      "a run out a plank and walked ashore.  Most everybody was on the boat.\n",
      " Pap, and Judge Thatcher, and Bessie Thatcher, and Jo Harper, and Tom\n",
      "Sawyer, and his old Aunt Polly, and Sid and Mary, and plenty more.\n",
      " Everybody was talking about the murder, but the captain broke in and\n",
      "says:\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Look sharp, now; the current sets in the closest here, and maybe he's\n",
      "washed ashore and got tangled amongst the brush at the water's edge.  I\n",
      "hope so, anyway.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "I didn't hope so.  They all crowded up and leaned over the rails, nearly\n",
      "in my face, and kept still, watching with all their might.  I could see\n",
      "them first-rate, but they couldn't see me.  Then the captain sung out:\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Stand away!\" and the cannon let off such a blast right before me that\n",
      "it made me deef with the noise and pretty near blind with the smoke, and\n",
      "I judged I was gone.  If they'd a had some bullets in, I reckon they'd\n",
      "a got the corpse they was after.  Well, I see I warn't hurt, thanks to\n",
      "goodness. The boat floated on and went out of sight around the shoulder\n",
      "of the island.  I could hear the booming now and then, further and\n",
      "further off, and by and by, after an hour, I didn't hear it no more.\n",
      " The island was three mile long.  I judged they had got to the foot, and\n",
      "was giving it up.  But they didn't yet a while.  They turned around\n",
      "the foot of the island and started up the channel on the Missouri side,\n",
      "under steam, and booming once in a while as they went.  I crossed over\n",
      "to that side and watched them. When they got abreast the head of the\n",
      "island they quit shooting and dropped over to the Missouri shore and\n",
      "went home to the town.\n",
      "\n",
      "I knowed I was all right now.  Nobody else would come a-hunting after\n",
      "me. I got my traps out of the canoe and made me a nice camp in the thick\n",
      "woods.  I made a kind of a tent out of my blankets to put my things\n",
      "under so the rain couldn't get at them.  I catched a catfish and haggled\n",
      "him open with my saw, and towards sundown I started my camp fire and had\n",
      "supper.  Then I set out a line to catch some fish for breakfast.\n",
      "\n",
      "When it was dark I set by my camp fire smoking, and feeling pretty well\n",
      "satisfied; but by and by it got sort of lonesome, and so I went and set\n",
      "on the bank and listened to the current swashing along, and counted the\n",
      "stars and drift logs and rafts that come down, and then went to bed;\n",
      "there ain't no better way to put in time when you are lonesome; you\n",
      "can't stay so, you soon get over it.\n",
      "\n",
      "And so for three days and nights.  No difference--just the same thing.\n",
      "But the next day I went exploring around down through the island.  I was\n",
      "boss of it; it all belonged to me, so to say, and I wanted to know\n",
      "all about it; but mainly I wanted to put in the time.  I found plenty\n",
      "strawberries, ripe and prime; and green summer grapes, and green\n",
      "razberries; and the green blackberries was just beginning to show.  They\n",
      "would all come handy by and by, I judged.\n",
      "\n",
      "Well, I went fooling along in the deep woods till I judged I warn't\n",
      "far from the foot of the island.  I had my gun along, but I hadn't shot\n",
      "nothing; it was for protection; thought I would kill some game nigh\n",
      "home. About this time I mighty near stepped on a good-sized snake,\n",
      "and it went sliding off through the grass and flowers, and I after\n",
      "it, trying to get a shot at it. I clipped along, and all of a sudden I\n",
      "bounded right on to the ashes of a camp fire that was still smoking.\n",
      "\n",
      "My heart jumped up amongst my lungs.  I never waited for to look\n",
      "further, but uncocked my gun and went sneaking back on my tiptoes as\n",
      "fast as ever I could.  Every now and then I stopped a second amongst the\n",
      "thick leaves and listened, but my breath come so hard I couldn't hear\n",
      "nothing else.  I slunk along another piece further, then listened again;\n",
      "and so on, and so on.  If I see a stump, I took it for a man; if I trod\n",
      "on a stick and broke it, it made me feel like a person had cut one of my\n",
      "breaths in two and I only got half, and the short half, too.\n",
      "\n",
      "When I got to camp I warn't feeling very brash, there warn't much sand\n",
      "in my craw; but I says, this ain't no time to be fooling around.  So I\n",
      "got all my traps into my canoe again so as to have them out of sight,\n",
      "and I put out the fire and scattered the ashes around to look like an\n",
      "old last year's camp, and then clumb a tree.\n",
      "\n",
      "I reckon I was up in the tree two hours; but I didn't see nothing,\n",
      "I didn't hear nothing--I only _thought_ I heard and seen as much as a\n",
      "thousand things.  Well, I couldn't stay up there forever; so at last I\n",
      "got down, but I kept in the thick woods and on the lookout all the\n",
      "time. All I could get to eat was berries and what was left over from\n",
      "breakfast.\n",
      "\n",
      "By the time it was night I was pretty hungry.  So when it was good\n",
      "and dark I slid out from shore before moonrise and paddled over to the\n",
      "Illinois bank--about a quarter of a mile.  I went out in the woods and\n",
      "cooked a supper, and I had about made up my mind I would stay there\n",
      "all night when I hear a _plunkety-plunk, plunkety-plunk_, and says\n",
      "to myself, horses coming; and next I hear people's voices.  I got\n",
      "everything into the canoe as quick as I could, and then went creeping\n",
      "through the woods to see what I could find out.  I hadn't got far when I\n",
      "hear a man say:\n",
      "\n",
      "\"We better camp here if we can find a good place; the horses is about\n",
      "beat out.  Let's look around.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "I didn't wait, but shoved out and paddled away easy.  I tied up in the\n",
      "old place, and reckoned I would sleep in the canoe.\n",
      "\n",
      "I didn't sleep much.  I couldn't, somehow, for thinking.  And every time\n",
      "I waked up I thought somebody had me by the neck.  So the sleep didn't\n",
      "do me no good.  By and by I says to myself, I can't live this way; I'm\n",
      "a-going to find out who it is that's here on the island with me; I'll\n",
      "find it out or bust.  Well, I felt better right off.\n",
      "\n",
      "So I took my paddle and slid out from shore just a step or two, and\n",
      "then let the canoe drop along down amongst the shadows.  The moon was\n",
      "shining, and outside of the shadows it made it most as light as day.\n",
      " I poked along well on to an hour, everything still as rocks and sound\n",
      "asleep. Well, by this time I was most down to the foot of the island.  A\n",
      "little ripply, cool breeze begun to blow, and that was as good as saying\n",
      "the night was about done.  I give her a turn with the paddle and brung\n",
      "her nose to shore; then I got my gun and slipped out and into the edge\n",
      "of the woods.  I sat down there on a log, and looked out through the\n",
      "leaves.  I see the moon go off watch, and the darkness begin to blanket\n",
      "the river. But in a little while I see a pale streak over the treetops,\n",
      "and knowed the day was coming.  So I took my gun and slipped off towards\n",
      "where I had run across that camp fire, stopping every minute or two\n",
      "to listen.  But I hadn't no luck somehow; I couldn't seem to find the\n",
      "place.  But by and by, sure enough, I catched a glimpse of fire away\n",
      "through the trees.  I went for it, cautious and slow.  By and by I was\n",
      "close enough to have a look, and there laid a man on the ground.  It\n",
      "most give me the fan-tods. He had a blanket around his head, and his\n",
      "head was nearly in the fire.  I set there behind a clump of bushes, in\n",
      "about six foot of him, and kept my eyes on him steady.  It was getting\n",
      "gray daylight now.  Pretty soon he gapped and stretched himself and hove\n",
      "off the blanket, and it was Miss Watson's Jim!  I bet I was glad to see\n",
      "him.  I says:\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Hello, Jim!\" and skipped out.\n",
      "\n",
      "He bounced up and stared at me wild.  Then he drops down on his knees,\n",
      "and puts his hands together and says:\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Doan' hurt me--don't!  I hain't ever done no harm to a ghos'.  I alwuz\n",
      "liked dead people, en done all I could for 'em.  You go en git in de\n",

      "\n",
      "Well, I warn't long making him understand I warn't dead.  I was ever so\n",
      "glad to see Jim.  I warn't lonesome now.  I told him I warn't afraid of\n",
      "_him_ telling the people where I was.  I talked along, but he only set\n",
      "there and looked at me; never said nothing.  Then I says:\n",
      "\n",
      "\"It's good daylight.  Le's get breakfast.  Make up your camp fire good.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"What's de use er makin' up de camp fire to cook strawbries en sich\n",

      "\"I couldn' git nuffn else,\" he says.\n",

      "\"No, sah--nuffn else.\"\n",
      "\n",

      "\n",
      "So we went over to where the canoe was, and while he built a fire in\n",
      "a grassy open place amongst the trees, I fetched meal and bacon and\n",
      "coffee, and coffee-pot and frying-pan, and sugar and tin cups, and the\n",
      "nigger was set back considerable, because he reckoned it was all done\n",

      "\n",
      "When breakfast was ready we lolled on the grass and eat it smoking hot.\n",
      "Jim laid it in with all his might, for he was most about starved.  Then\n",

      "I wanted to go and look at a place right about the middle of the island\n",
      "that I'd found when I was exploring; so we started and soon got to it,\n",
      "because the island was only three miles long and a quarter of a mile\n",
      "wide.\n",
      "\n",
      "This place was a tolerable long, steep hill or ridge about forty foot\n",
      "high. We had a rough time getting to the top, the sides was so steep and\n",
      "the bushes so thick.  We tramped and clumb around all over it, and by\n",
      "and by found a good big cavern in the rock, most up to the top on the\n",
      "side towards Illinois.  The cavern was as big as two or three rooms\n",
      "bunched together, and Jim could stand up straight in it.  It was cool in\n",
      "there. Jim was for putting our traps in there right away, but I said we\n",
      "didn't want to be climbing up and down there all the time.\n",
      "\n",
      "Jim said if we had the canoe hid in a good place, and had all the traps\n",
      "in the cavern, we could rush there if anybody was to come to the island,\n",
      "and they would never find us without dogs.  And, besides, he said them\n",
      "little birds had said it was going to rain, and did I want the things to\n",
      "get wet?\n",
      "\n",
      "So we went back and got the canoe, and paddled up abreast the cavern,\n",
      "and lugged all the traps up there.  Then we hunted up a place close by\n",
      "to hide the canoe in, amongst the thick willows.  We took some fish off\n",
      "of the lines and set them again, and begun to get ready for dinner.\n",
      "\n",
      "The door of the cavern was big enough to roll a hogshead in, and on one\n",
      "side of the door the floor stuck out a little bit, and was flat and a\n",
      "good place to build a fire on.  So we built it there and cooked dinner.\n",
      "\n",
      "We spread the blankets inside for a carpet, and eat our dinner in there.\n",
      "We put all the other things handy at the back of the cavern.  Pretty\n",
      "soon it darkened up, and begun to thunder and lighten; so the birds was\n",
      "right about it.  Directly it begun to rain, and it rained like all fury,\n",
      "too, and I never see the wind blow so.  It was one of these regular\n",
      "summer storms.  It would get so dark that it looked all blue-black\n",
      "outside, and lovely; and the rain would thrash along by so thick that\n",
      "the trees off a little ways looked dim and spider-webby; and here would\n",
      "come a blast of wind that would bend the trees down and turn up the\n",
      "pale underside of the leaves; and then a perfect ripper of a gust would\n",
      "follow along and set the branches to tossing their arms as if they\n",
      "was just wild; and next, when it was just about the bluest and\n",
      "blackest--_FST_! it was as bright as glory, and you'd have a little\n",
      "glimpse of tree-tops a-plunging about away off yonder in the storm,\n",
      "hundreds of yards further than you could see before; dark as sin again\n",
      "in a second, and now you'd hear the thunder let go with an awful crash,\n",
      "and then go rumbling, grumbling, tumbling, down the sky towards the\n",
      "under side of the world, like rolling empty barrels down stairs--where\n",
      "it's long stairs and they bounce a good deal, you know.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Jim, this is nice,\" I says.  \"I wouldn't want to be nowhere else but\n",

      "The river went on raising and raising for ten or twelve days, till at\n",
      "last it was over the banks.  The water was three or four foot deep on\n",
      "the island in the low places and on the Illinois bottom.  On that side\n",
      "it was a good many miles wide, but on the Missouri side it was the same\n",
      "old distance across--a half a mile--because the Missouri shore was just a\n",
      "wall of high bluffs.\n",
      "\n",
      "Daytimes we paddled all over the island in the canoe, It was mighty cool\n",
      "and shady in the deep woods, even if the sun was blazing outside.  We\n",
      "went winding in and out amongst the trees, and sometimes the vines hung\n",
      "so thick we had to back away and go some other way.  Well, on every old\n",
      "broken-down tree you could see rabbits and snakes and such things; and\n",
      "when the island had been overflowed a day or two they got so tame, on\n",
      "account of being hungry, that you could paddle right up and put your\n",
      "hand on them if you wanted to; but not the snakes and turtles--they would\n",
      "slide off in the water.  The ridge our cavern was in was full of them.\n",
      "We could a had pets enough if we'd wanted them.\n",
      "\n",
      "One night we catched a little section of a lumber raft--nice pine planks.\n",
      "It was twelve foot wide and about fifteen or sixteen foot long, and\n",
      "the top stood above water six or seven inches--a solid, level floor.  We\n",
      "could see saw-logs go by in the daylight sometimes, but we let them go;\n",
      "we didn't show ourselves in daylight.\n",
      "\n",
      "Another night when we was up at the head of the island, just before\n",
      "daylight, here comes a frame-house down, on the west side.  She was\n",
      "a two-story, and tilted over considerable.  We paddled out and got\n",
      "aboard--clumb in at an upstairs window.  But it was too dark to see yet,\n",
      "so we made the canoe fast and set in her to wait for daylight.\n",
      "\n",
      "The light begun to come before we got to the foot of the island.  Then\n",
      "we looked in at the window.  We could make out a bed, and a table, and\n",
      "two old chairs, and lots of things around about on the floor, and there\n",
      "was clothes hanging against the wall.  There was something laying on the\n",
      "floor in the far corner that looked like a man.  So Jim says:\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Hello, you!\"\n",
      "\n",
      "But it didn't budge.  So I hollered again, and then Jim says:\n",
      "\n",
      "\"De man ain't asleep--he's dead.  You hold still--I'll go en see.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "He went, and bent down and looked, and says:\n",

      "at his face--it's too gashly.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "I didn't look at him at all.  Jim throwed some old rags over him, but\n",
      "he needn't done it; I didn't want to see him.  There was heaps of old\n",
      "greasy cards scattered around over the floor, and old whisky bottles,\n",
      "and a couple of masks made out of black cloth; and all over the walls\n",
      "was the ignorantest kind of words and pictures made with charcoal.\n",
      " There was two old dirty calico dresses, and a sun-bonnet, and some\n",
      "women's underclothes hanging against the wall, and some men's clothing,\n",
      "too.  We put the lot into the canoe--it might come good.  There was a\n",
      "boy's old speckled straw hat on the floor; I took that, too.  And there\n",
      "was a bottle that had had milk in it, and it had a rag stopper for a\n",
      "baby to suck.  We would a took the bottle, but it was broke.  There was\n",
      "a seedy old chest, and an old hair trunk with the hinges broke.  They\n",
      "stood open, but there warn't nothing left in them that was any account.\n",
      " The way things was scattered about we reckoned the people left in a\n",
      "hurry, and warn't fixed so as to carry off most of their stuff.\n",
      "\n",
      "We got an old tin lantern, and a butcher-knife without any handle, and\n",
      "a bran-new Barlow knife worth two bits in any store, and a lot of tallow\n",
      "candles, and a tin candlestick, and a gourd, and a tin cup, and a ratty\n",
      "old bedquilt off the bed, and a reticule with needles and pins and\n",
      "beeswax and buttons and thread and all such truck in it, and a hatchet\n",
      "and some nails, and a fishline as thick as my little finger with some\n",
      "monstrous hooks on it, and a roll of buckskin, and a leather dog-collar,\n",
      "and a horseshoe, and some vials of medicine that didn't have no label\n",
      "on them; and just as we was leaving I found a tolerable good curry-comb,\n",
      "and Jim he found a ratty old fiddle-bow, and a wooden leg.  The straps\n",
      "was broke off of it, but, barring that, it was a good enough leg, though\n",

      "\n",

      "body and roast a piece of it.  I done it, and he eat it and said it\n",
      "would help cure him. He made me take off the rattles and tie them around\n",
      "his wrist, too.  He said that that would help.  Then I slid out quiet\n",

      "hooks with a skinned rabbit and set it and catch a catfish that was\n",
      "as big as a man, being six foot two inches long, and weighed over two\n",
      "hundred pounds. We couldn't handle him, of course; he would a flung us\n",
      "into Illinois.  We just set there and watched him rip and tear around\n",
      "till he drownded.  We found a brass button in his stomach and a round\n",
      "ball, and lots of rubbage.  We split the ball open with the hatchet,\n",
      "and there was a spool in it.  Jim said he'd had it there a long time, to\n",
      "coat it over so and make a ball of it.  It was as big a fish as was ever\n",
      "catched in the Mississippi, I reckon.  Jim said he hadn't ever seen\n",
      "a bigger one.  He would a been worth a good deal over at the village.\n",

      "find out what was going on.  Jim liked that notion; but he said I\n",
      "must go in the dark and look sharp.  Then he studied it over and said,\n",
      "couldn't I put on some of them old things and dress up like a girl?\n",
      " That was a good notion, too.  So we shortened up one of the calico\n",
      "gowns, and I turned up my trouser-legs to my knees and got into it.  Jim\n",
      "hitched it behind with the hooks, and it was a fair fit.  I put on the\n",
      "sun-bonnet and tied it under my chin, and then for a body to look in\n",
      "and see my face was like looking down a joint of stove-pipe.  Jim said\n",
      "nobody would know me, even in the daytime, hardly.  I practiced around\n",
      "all day to get the hang of the things, and by and by I could do pretty\n",

      "tolerable sick rat.  She said that was first-rate, and she reckoned I\n",
      "would hive the next one.  She went and got the lump of lead and fetched\n",
      "it back, and brought along a hank of yarn which she wanted me to help\n",
      "her with.  I held up my two hands and she put the hank over them, and\n",

      "along we was going to take to the canoe and break for the Illinois\n",
      "shore; and it was well a boat didn't come, for we hadn't ever thought to\n",
      "put the gun in the canoe, or a fishing-line, or anything to eat.  We\n",

      "\n",
      "If the men went to the island I just expect they found the camp fire I\n",

      "\n",
      "When the first streak of day began to show we tied up to a towhead in a\n",
      "big bend on the Illinois side, and hacked off cottonwood branches with\n",
      "the hatchet, and covered up the raft with them so she looked like there\n",
      "had been a cave-in in the bank there.  A tow-head is a sandbar that has\n",
      "cottonwoods on it as thick as harrow-teeth.\n",
      "\n",
      "We had mountains on the Missouri shore and heavy timber on the Illinois\n",
      "side, and the channel was down the Missouri shore at that place, so we\n",
      "warn't afraid of anybody running across us.  We laid there all day,\n",
      "and watched the rafts and steamboats spin down the Missouri shore, and\n",
      "up-bound steamboats fight the big river in the middle.  I told Jim all\n",
      "about the time I had jabbering with that woman; and Jim said she was\n",
      "a smart one, and if she was to start after us herself she wouldn't set\n",
      "down and watch a camp fire--no, sir, she'd fetch a dog.  Well, then, I\n",
      "said, why couldn't she tell her husband to fetch a dog?  Jim said he\n",
      "bet she did think of it by the time the men was ready to start, and he\n",
      "believed they must a gone up-town to get a dog and so they lost all that\n",
      "time, or else we wouldn't be here on a towhead sixteen or seventeen mile\n",
      "below the village--no, indeedy, we would be in that same old town again.\n",
      " So I said I didn't care what was the reason they didn't get us as long\n",
      "as they didn't.\n",
      "\n",
      "When it was beginning to come on dark we poked our heads out of the\n",
      "cottonwood thicket, and looked up and down and across; nothing in sight;\n",
      "so Jim took up some of the top planks of the raft and built a snug\n",
      "wigwam to get under in blazing weather and rainy, and to keep the things\n",
      "dry. Jim made a floor for the wigwam, and raised it a foot or more above\n",
      "the level of the raft, so now the blankets and all the traps was out of\n",
      "reach of steamboat waves.  Right in the middle of the wigwam we made a\n",
      "layer of dirt about five or six inches deep with a frame around it for\n",
      "to hold it to its place; this was to build a fire on in sloppy weather\n",
      "or chilly; the wigwam would keep it from being seen.  We made an extra\n",
      "steering-oar, too, because one of the others might get broke on a snag\n",
      "or something. We fixed up a short forked stick to hang the old lantern\n",
      "on, because we must always light the lantern whenever we see a steamboat\n",
      "coming down-stream, to keep from getting run over; but we wouldn't have\n",
      "to light it for up-stream boats unless we see we was in what they call\n",
      "a \"crossing\"; for the river was pretty high yet, very low banks being\n",
      "still a little under water; so up-bound boats didn't always run the\n",

      "\n",
      "This second night we run between seven and eight hours, with a current\n",
      "that was making over four mile an hour.  We catched fish and talked,\n",
      "and we took a swim now and then to keep off sleepiness.  It was kind of\n",
      "solemn, drifting down the big, still river, laying on our backs looking\n",
      "up at the stars, and we didn't ever feel like talking loud, and it\n",
      "warn't often that we laughed--only a little kind of a low chuckle.  We\n",
      "had mighty good weather as a general thing, and nothing ever happened to\n",
      "us at all--that night, nor the next, nor the next.\n",
      "\n",
      "Every night we passed towns, some of them away up on black hillsides,\n",
      "nothing but just a shiny bed of lights; not a house could you see.  The\n",
      "fifth night we passed St. Louis, and it was like the whole world lit up.\n",
      "In St. Petersburg they used to say there was twenty or thirty thousand\n",
      "people in St. Louis, but I never believed it till I see that wonderful\n",
      "spread of lights at two o'clock that still night.  There warn't a sound\n",
      "there; everybody was asleep.\n",
      "\n",
      "Every night now I used to slip ashore towards ten o'clock at some little\n",
      "village, and buy ten or fifteen cents' worth of meal or bacon or other\n",
      "stuff to eat; and sometimes I lifted a chicken that warn't roosting\n",
      "comfortable, and took him along.  Pap always said, take a chicken when\n",
      "you get a chance, because if you don't want him yourself you can easy\n",
      "find somebody that does, and a good deed ain't ever forgot.  I never see\n",
      "pap when he didn't want the chicken himself, but that is what he used to\n",
      "say, anyway.\n",
      "\n",
      "Mornings before daylight I slipped into cornfields and borrowed a\n",
      "watermelon, or a mushmelon, or a punkin, or some new corn, or things of\n",
      "that kind.  Pap always said it warn't no harm to borrow things if you\n",
      "was meaning to pay them back some time; but the widow said it warn't\n",
      "anything but a soft name for stealing, and no decent body would do it.\n",
      " Jim said he reckoned the widow was partly right and pap was partly\n",
      "right; so the best way would be for us to pick out two or three things\n",
      "from the list and say we wouldn't borrow them any more--then he reckoned\n",
      "it wouldn't be no harm to borrow the others.  So we talked it over all\n",
      "one night, drifting along down the river, trying to make up our minds\n",
      "whether to drop the watermelons, or the cantelopes, or the mushmelons,\n",
      "or what.  But towards daylight we got it all settled satisfactory, and\n",
      "concluded to drop crabapples and p'simmons.  We warn't feeling just\n",
      "right before that, but it was all comfortable now.  I was glad the way\n",
      "it come out, too, because crabapples ain't ever good, and the p'simmons\n",
      "wouldn't be ripe for two or three months yet.\n",
      "\n",
      "We shot a water-fowl now and then that got up too early in the morning\n",
      "or didn't go to bed early enough in the evening.  Take it all round, we\n",
      "lived pretty high.\n",
      "\n",
      "The fifth night below St. Louis we had a big storm after midnight, with\n",
      "a power of thunder and lightning, and the rain poured down in a solid\n",
      "sheet. We stayed in the wigwam and let the raft take care of itself.\n",
      "When the lightning glared out we could see a big straight river ahead,\n",
      "and high, rocky bluffs on both sides.  By and by says I, \"Hel-_lo_, Jim,\n",
      "looky yonder!\" It was a steamboat that had killed herself on a rock.\n",
      " We was drifting straight down for her.  The lightning showed her very\n",
      "distinct.  She was leaning over, with part of her upper deck above\n",
      "water, and you could see every little chimbly-guy clean and clear, and a\n",
      "chair by the big bell, with an old slouch hat hanging on the back of it,\n",
      "when the flashes come.\n",
      "\n",
      "Well, it being away in the night and stormy, and all so mysterious-like,\n",
      "I felt just the way any other boy would a felt when I see that wreck\n",
      "laying there so mournful and lonesome in the middle of the river.  I\n",
      "wanted to get aboard of her and slink around a little, and see what\n",
      "there was there.  So I says:\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Le's land on her, Jim.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "But Jim was dead against it at first.  He says:\n",

      "\n",
      "\"Watchman your grandmother,\" I says; \"there ain't nothing to watch but\n",
      "the texas and the pilot-house; and do you reckon anybody's going to resk\n",
      "his life for a texas and a pilot-house such a night as this, when\n",
      "it's likely to break up and wash off down the river any minute?\"  Jim\n",
      "couldn't say nothing to that, so he didn't try.  \"And besides,\" I says,\n",
      "\"we might borrow something worth having out of the captain's stateroom.\n",
      " Seegars, I bet you--and cost five cents apiece, solid cash.  Steamboat\n",
      "captains is always rich, and get sixty dollars a month, and _they_ don't\n",
      "care a cent what a thing costs, you know, long as they want it.  Stick a\n",
      "candle in your pocket; I can't rest, Jim, till we give her a rummaging.\n",
      " Do you reckon Tom Sawyer would ever go by this thing?  Not for pie, he\n",
      "wouldn't. He'd call it an adventure--that's what he'd call it; and he'd\n",
      "land on that wreck if it was his last act.  And wouldn't he throw style\n",
      "into it?--wouldn't he spread himself, nor nothing?  Why, you'd think it\n",
      "was Christopher C'lumbus discovering Kingdom-Come.  I wish Tom Sawyer\n",
      "_was_ here.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "Jim he grumbled a little, but give in.  He said we mustn't talk any more\n",
      "than we could help, and then talk mighty low.  The lightning showed us\n",
      "the wreck again just in time, and we fetched the stabboard derrick, and\n",
      "made fast there.\n",
      "\n",
      "The deck was high out here.  We went sneaking down the slope of it to\n",

      "feet, and spreading our hands out to fend off the guys, for it was so\n",
      "dark we couldn't see no sign of them.  Pretty soon we struck the forward\n",
      "end of the skylight, and clumb on to it; and the next step fetched us in\n",
      "front of the captain's door, which was open, and by Jimminy, away down\n",
      "through the texas-hall we see a light! and all in the same second we\n",
      "seem to hear low voices in yonder!\n",
      "\n",
      "Jim whispered and said he was feeling powerful sick, and told me to come\n",
      "along.  I says, all right, and was going to start for the raft; but just\n",
      "then I heard a voice wail out and say:\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Oh, please don't, boys; I swear I won't ever tell!\"\n",
      "\n",
      "Another voice said, pretty loud:\n",

      "\n",

      "curiosity; and I says to myself, Tom Sawyer wouldn't back out now,\n",
      "and so I won't either; I'm a-going to see what's going on here.  So I\n",
      "dropped on my hands and knees in the little passage, and crept aft\n",
      "in the dark till there warn't but one stateroom betwixt me and the\n",
      "cross-hall of the texas.  Then in there I see a man stretched on the\n",
      "floor and tied hand and foot, and two men standing over him, and one\n",
      "of them had a dim lantern in his hand, and the other one had a pistol.\n",

      "Packard didn't take no notice of that, but hung up his lantern on a nail\n",

      "to come.  I crawfished as fast as I could about two yards, but the boat\n",
      "slanted so that I couldn't make very good time; so to keep from getting\n",

      "\n",

      "in the upper berth, cornered, and sorry I come.  Then they stood there,\n",
      "with their hands on the ledge of the berth, and talked.  I couldn't see\n",
      "them, but I could tell where they was by the whisky they'd been having.\n",
      " I was glad I didn't drink whisky; but it wouldn't made much difference\n",

      "little dim glimpses of them on both sides of me--sometimes just a narrow\n",
      "channel between, and some that I couldn't see I knowed was there because\n",
      "I'd hear the wash of the current against the old dead brush and trash\n",

      "WE slept most all day, and started out at night, a little ways behind a\n",
      "monstrous long raft that was as long going by as a procession.  She had\n",
      "four long sweeps at each end, so we judged she carried as many as thirty\n",
      "men, likely.  She had five big wigwams aboard, wide apart, and an open\n",
      "camp fire in the middle, and a tall flag-pole at each end.  There was a\n",
      "power of style about her.  It _amounted_ to something being a raftsman\n",
      "on such a craft as that.\n",
      "\n",
      "We went drifting down into a big bend, and the night clouded up and got\n",
      "hot.  The river was very wide, and was walled with solid timber on\n",
      "both sides; you couldn't see a break in it hardly ever, or a light.  We\n",
      "talked about Cairo, and wondered whether we would know it when we got to\n",
      "it.  I said likely we wouldn't, because I had heard say there warn't but\n",
      "about a dozen houses there, and if they didn't happen to have them lit\n",
      "up, how was we going to know we was passing a town?  Jim said if the two\n",
      "big rivers joined together there, that would show.  But I said maybe\n",
      "we might think we was passing the foot of an island and coming into the\n",
      "same old river again. That disturbed Jim--and me too.  So the question\n",
      "was, what to do?  I said, paddle ashore the first time a light showed,\n",
      "and tell them pap was behind, coming along with a trading-scow, and\n",
      "was a green hand at the business, and wanted to know how far it was to\n",
      "Cairo.  Jim thought it was a good idea, so we took a smoke on it and\n",
      "waited.\n",
      "\n",
      "There warn't nothing to do now but to look out sharp for the town, and\n",
      "not pass it without seeing it.  He said he'd be mighty sure to see it,\n",
      "because he'd be a free man the minute he seen it, but if he missed it\n",
      "he'd be in a slave country again and no more show for freedom.  Every\n",

      "\n",
      "But it warn't.  It was Jack-o'-lanterns, or lightning bugs; so he set\n",

      "all over trembly and feverish to be so close to freedom.  Well, I can\n",
      "tell you it made me all over trembly and feverish, too, to hear him,\n",
      "because I begun to get it through my head that he _was_ most free--and\n",
      "who was to blame for it?  Why, _me_.  I couldn't get that out of my\n",
      "conscience, no how nor no way. It got to troubling me so I couldn't\n",
      "rest; I couldn't stay still in one place.  It hadn't ever come home to\n",
      "me before, what this thing was that I was doing.  But now it did; and it\n",
      "stayed with me, and scorched me more and more.  I tried to make out to\n",
      "myself that I warn't to blame, because I didn't run Jim off from his\n",
      "rightful owner; but it warn't no use, conscience up and says, every\n",

      "that noway.  That was where it pinched.  Conscience says to me, \"What\n",

      "got enough he would buy his wife, which was owned on a farm close to\n",

      "\n",
      "It most froze me to hear such talk.  He wouldn't ever dared to talk such\n",

      "\"Give a nigger an inch and he'll take an ell.\"  Thinks I, this is what\n",

      "here, I'll tell you what to do.  Don't you try to land by yourself, or\n",
      "you'll smash everything to pieces.  You float along down about twenty\n",
      "miles, and you'll come to a town on the left-hand side of the river.  It\n",

      "your folks are all down with chills and fever.  Don't be a fool again,\n",
      "and let people guess what is the matter.  Now we're trying to do you a\n",
      "kindness; so you just put twenty miles between us, that's a good boy.\n",
      " It wouldn't do any good to land yonder where the light is--it's only a\n",
      "wood-yard. Say, I reckon your father's poor, and I'm bound to say he's\n",
      "in pretty hard luck.  Here, I'll put a twenty-dollar gold piece on this\n",
      "board, and you get it when it floats by.  I feel mighty mean to leave\n",

      "he's little ain't got no show--when the pinch comes there ain't nothing\n",
      "to back him up and keep him to his work, and so he gets beat.  Then I\n",

      "and give Jim up, would you felt better than what you do now?  No, says\n",

      "\n",
      "I went into the wigwam; Jim warn't there.  I looked all around; he\n",

      "Then we talked about the money.  It was a pretty good raise--twenty\n",
      "dollars apiece.  Jim said we could take deck passage on a steamboat\n",
      "now, and the money would last us as far as we wanted to go in the free\n",
      "States. He said twenty mile more warn't far for the raft to go, but he\n",
      "wished we was already there.\n",
      "\n",
      "Towards daybreak we tied up, and Jim was mighty particular about hiding\n",

      "\n",
      "That night about ten we hove in sight of the lights of a town away down\n",

      "\n",
      "I went off in the canoe to ask about it.  Pretty soon I found a man out\n",

      "close to the left-hand bank.  I begun to suspicion something.  So did\n",

      "When it was daylight, here was the clear Ohio water inshore, sure\n",
      "enough, and outside was the old regular Muddy!  So it was all up with\n",
      "Cairo.\n",
      "\n",
      "We talked it all over.  It wouldn't do to take to the shore; we couldn't\n",
      "take the raft up the stream, of course.  There warn't no way but to wait\n",
      "for dark, and start back in the canoe and take the chances.  So we slept\n",

      "\n",

      "By and by we talked about what we better do, and found there warn't no\n",

      "anybody around, the way pap would do, for that might set people after\n",

      "The place to buy canoes is off of rafts laying up at shore.  But we\n",

      "more.  Well, the night got gray and ruther thick, which is the next\n",
      "meanest thing to fog.  You can't tell the shape of the river, and you\n",
      "can't see no distance. It got to be very late and still, and then along\n",
      "comes a steamboat up the river.  We lit the lantern, and judged she\n",

      "how close they can come without touching; sometimes the wheel bites off\n",
      "a sweep, and then the pilot sticks his head out and laughs, and thinks\n",
      "he's mighty smart.  Well, here she comes, and we said she was going to\n",

      "like red-hot teeth, and her monstrous bows and guards hanging right\n",
      "over us.  There was a yell at us, and a jingling of bells to stop the\n",

      "my nose, and puffed a bit.  Of course there was a booming current; and\n",

      "town. There warn't no bed in the parlor, nor a sign of a bed; but heaps\n",
      "of parlors in towns has beds in them.  There was a big fireplace that\n",
      "was bricked on the bottom, and the bricks was kept clean and red by\n",
      "pouring water on them and scrubbing them with another brick; sometimes\n",
      "they wash them over with red water-paint that they call Spanish-brown,\n",
      "same as they do in town.  They had big brass dog-irons that could hold\n",
      "up a saw-log. There was a clock on the middle of the mantelpiece, with\n",
      "a picture of a town painted on the bottom half of the glass front, and\n",
      "a round place in the middle of it for the sun, and you could see the\n",

      "and when you pressed down on them they squeaked, but didn't open\n",
      "their mouths nor look different nor interested.  They squeaked through\n",
      "underneath.  There was a couple of big wild-turkey-wing fans spread out\n",
      "behind those things.  On the table in the middle of the room was a kind\n",
      "of a lovely crockery basket that had apples and oranges and peaches and\n",
      "grapes piled up in it, which was much redder and yellower and prettier\n",
      "than real ones is, but they warn't real because you could see where\n",

      "was, underneath.\n",
      "\n",
      "This table had a cover made out of beautiful oilcloth, with a red and\n",
      "blue spread-eagle painted on it, and a painted border all around.  It\n",
      "come all the way from Philadelphia, they said.  There was some books,\n",
      "too, piled up perfectly exact, on each corner of the table.  One was a\n",
      "big family Bible full of pictures.  One was Pilgrim's Progress, about a\n",
      "man that left his family, it didn't say why.  I read considerable in it\n",
      "now and then.  The statements was interesting, but tough.  Another was\n",
      "Friendship's Offering, full of beautiful stuff and poetry; but I didn't\n",
      "read the poetry.  Another was Henry Clay's Speeches, and another was Dr.\n",
      "Gunn's Family Medicine, which told you all about what to do if a body\n",
      "was sick or dead.  There was a hymn book, and a lot of other books.  And\n",
      "there was nice split-bottom chairs, and perfectly sound, too--not bagged\n",
      "down in the middle and busted, like an old basket.\n",
      "\n",
      "They had pictures hung on the walls--mainly Washingtons and Lafayettes,\n",
      "and battles, and Highland Marys, and one called \"Signing the\n",
      "Declaration.\" There was some that they called crayons, which one of the\n",
      "daughters which was dead made her own self when she was only\n",
      "fifteen years old.  They was different from any pictures I ever see\n",
      "before--blacker, mostly, than is common.  One was a woman in a slim black\n",
      "dress, belted small under the armpits, with bulges like a cabbage in\n",
      "the middle of the sleeves, and a large black scoop-shovel bonnet with\n",
      "a black veil, and white slim ankles crossed about with black tape, and\n",
      "very wee black slippers, like a chisel, and she was leaning pensive on a\n",
      "tombstone on her right elbow, under a weeping willow, and her other hand\n",
      "hanging down her side holding a white handkerchief and a reticule,\n",
      "and underneath the picture it said \"Shall I Never See Thee More Alas.\"\n",
      " Another one was a young lady with her hair all combed up straight\n",
      "to the top of her head, and knotted there in front of a comb like a\n",
      "chair-back, and she was crying into a handkerchief and had a dead bird\n",
      "laying on its back in her other hand with its heels up, and underneath\n",
      "the picture it said \"I Shall Never Hear Thy Sweet Chirrup More Alas.\"\n",
      " There was one where a young lady was at a window looking up at the\n",
      "moon, and tears running down her cheeks; and she had an open letter in\n",
      "one hand with black sealing wax showing on one edge of it, and she was\n",
      "mashing a locket with a chain to it against her mouth, and underneath\n",
      "the picture it said \"And Art Thou Gone Yes Thou Art Gone Alas.\"  These\n",
      "was all nice pictures, I reckon, but I didn't somehow seem to take\n",
      "to them, because if ever I was down a little they always give me the\n",
      "fan-tods.  Everybody was sorry she died, because she had laid out a lot\n",
      "more of these pictures to do, and a body could see by what she had done\n",
      "what they had lost.  But I reckoned that with her disposition she was\n",
      "having a better time in the graveyard.  She was at work on what they\n",
      "said was her greatest picture when she took sick, and every day and\n",
      "every night it was her prayer to be allowed to live till she got it\n",
      "done, but she never got the chance.  It was a picture of a young woman\n",
      "in a long white gown, standing on the rail of a bridge all ready to jump\n",
      "off, with her hair all down her back, and looking up to the moon, with\n",
      "the tears running down her face, and she had two arms folded across her\n",
      "breast, and two arms stretched out in front, and two more reaching up\n",
      "towards the moon--and the idea was to see which pair would look best,\n",
      "and then scratch out all the other arms; but, as I was saying, she died\n",
      "before she got her mind made up, and now they kept this picture over the\n",
      "head of the bed in her room, and every time her birthday come they hung\n",
      "flowers on it.  Other times it was hid with a little curtain.  The young\n",
      "woman in the picture had a kind of a nice sweet face, but there was so\n",
      "many arms it made her look too spidery, seemed to me.\n",
      "\n",
      "This young girl kept a scrap-book when she was alive, and used to paste\n",

      "Every time a man died, or a woman died, or a child died, she would be on\n",
      "hand with her \"tribute\" before he was cold.  She called them tributes.\n",
      "The neighbors said it was the doctor first, then Emmeline, then the\n",
      "undertaker--the undertaker never got in ahead of Emmeline but once, and\n",
      "then she hung fire on a rhyme for the dead person's name, which was\n",
      "Whistler.  She warn't ever the same after that; she never complained,\n",
      "but she kinder pined away and did not live long.  Poor thing, many's the\n",

      "out her poor old scrap-book and read in it when her pictures had been\n",

      "family, dead ones and all, and warn't going to let anything come between\n",
      "us.  Poor Emmeline made poetry about all the dead people when she was\n",
      "alive, and it didn't seem right that there warn't nobody to make some\n",
      "about her now she was gone; so I tried to sweat out a verse or two\n",
      "myself, but I couldn't seem to make it go somehow.  They kept Emmeline's\n",
      "room trim and nice, and all the things fixed in it just the way she\n",
      "liked to have them when she was alive, and nobody ever slept there.\n",

      "old piano, too, that had tin pans in it, I reckon, and nothing was ever\n",
      "so lovely as to hear the young ladies sing \"The Last Link is Broken\"\n",
      "and play \"The Battle of Prague\" on it.  The walls of all the rooms was\n",
      "plastered, and most had carpets on the floors, and the whole house was\n",
      "whitewashed on the outside.\n",
      "\n",
      "It was a double house, and the big open place betwixt them was roofed\n",
      "and floored, and sometimes the table was set there in the middle of the\n",

      "\n",
      "COL.  Grangerford was a gentleman, you see.  He was a gentleman all\n",
      "over; and so was his family.  He was well born, as the saying is, and\n",
      "that's worth as much in a man as it is in a horse, so the Widow Douglas\n",
      "said, and nobody ever denied that she was of the first aristocracy\n",
      "in our town; and pap he always said it, too, though he warn't no more\n",
      "quality than a mudcat himself.  Col.  Grangerford was very tall and\n",
      "very slim, and had a darkish-paly complexion, not a sign of red in it\n",
      "anywheres; he was clean shaved every morning all over his thin face, and\n",
      "he had the thinnest kind of lips, and the thinnest kind of nostrils, and\n",
      "a high nose, and heavy eyebrows, and the blackest kind of eyes, sunk so\n",
      "deep back that they seemed like they was looking out of caverns at\n",
      "you, as you may say.  His forehead was high, and his hair was black and\n",
      "straight and hung to his shoulders. His hands was long and thin, and\n",
      "every day of his life he put on a clean shirt and a full suit from head\n",
      "to foot made out of linen so white it hurt your eyes to look at it;\n",
      "and on Sundays he wore a blue tail-coat with brass buttons on it.  He\n",
      "carried a mahogany cane with a silver head to it.  There warn't no\n",
      "frivolishness about him, not a bit, and he warn't ever loud.  He was\n",
      "as kind as he could be--you could feel that, you know, and so you had\n",
      "confidence.  Sometimes he smiled, and it was good to see; but when he\n",
      "straightened himself up like a liberty-pole, and the lightning begun to\n",
      "flicker out from under his eyebrows, you wanted to climb a tree first,\n",
      "and find out what the matter was afterwards.  He didn't ever have to\n",
      "tell anybody to mind their manners--everybody was always good-mannered\n",
      "where he was.  Everybody loved to have him around, too; he was sunshine\n",
      "most always--I mean he made it seem like good weather.  When he turned\n",
      "into a cloudbank it was awful dark for half a minute, and that was\n",
      "enough; there wouldn't nothing go wrong again for a week.\n",
      "\n",
      "When him and the old lady come down in the morning all the family got\n",
      "up out of their chairs and give them good-day, and didn't set down again\n",
      "till they had set down.  Then Tom and Bob went to the sideboard where\n",
      "the decanter was, and mixed a glass of bitters and handed it to him, and\n",
      "he held it in his hand and waited till Tom's and Bob's was mixed, and\n",
      "then they bowed and said, \"Our duty to you, sir, and madam;\" and _they_\n",
      "bowed the least bit in the world and said thank you, and so they drank,\n",
      "all three, and Bob and Tom poured a spoonful of water on the sugar and\n",
      "the mite of whisky or apple brandy in the bottom of their tumblers, and\n",
      "give it to me and Buck, and we drank to the old people too.\n",
      "\n",
      "Bob was the oldest and Tom next--tall, beautiful men with very broad\n",
      "shoulders and brown faces, and long black hair and black eyes.  They\n",
      "dressed in white linen from head to foot, like the old gentleman, and\n",
      "wore broad Panama hats.\n",
      "\n",
      "Then there was Miss Charlotte; she was twenty-five, and tall and proud\n",
      "and grand, but as good as she could be when she warn't stirred up; but\n",
      "when she was she had a look that would make you wilt in your tracks,\n",
      "like her father.  She was beautiful.\n",
      "\n",
      "So was her sister, Miss Sophia, but it was a different kind.  She was\n",
      "gentle and sweet like a dove, and she was only twenty.\n",
      "\n",
      "Each person had their own nigger to wait on them--Buck too.  My nigger\n",
      "had a monstrous easy time, because I warn't used to having anybody do\n",
      "anything for me, but Buck's was on the jump most of the time.\n",
      "\n",
      "This was all there was of the family now, but there used to be\n",
      "more--three sons; they got killed; and Emmeline that died.\n",
      "\n",
      "The old gentleman owned a lot of farms and over a hundred niggers.\n",
      "Sometimes a stack of people would come there, horseback, from ten or\n",
      "fifteen mile around, and stay five or six days, and have such junketings\n",
      "round about and on the river, and dances and picnics in the woods\n",
      "daytimes, and balls at the house nights.  These people was mostly\n",
      "kinfolks of the family.  The men brought their guns with them.  It was a\n",
      "handsome lot of quality, I tell you.\n",
      "\n",
      "There was another clan of aristocracy around there--five or six\n",
      "families--mostly of the name of Shepherdson.  They was as high-toned\n",
      "and well born and rich and grand as the tribe of Grangerfords.  The\n",
      "Shepherdsons and Grangerfords used the same steamboat landing, which was\n",
      "about two mile above our house; so sometimes when I went up there with a\n",
      "lot of our folks I used to see a lot of the Shepherdsons there on their\n",
      "fine horses.\n",
      "\n",
      "One day Buck and me was away out in the woods hunting, and heard a horse\n",
      "coming.  We was crossing the road.  Buck says:\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Quick!  Jump for the woods!\"\n",
      "\n",
      "We done it, and then peeped down the woods through the leaves.  Pretty\n",
      "soon a splendid young man come galloping down the road, setting his\n",
      "horse easy and looking like a soldier.  He had his gun across his\n",
      "pommel.  I had seen him before.  It was young Harney Shepherdson.  I\n",
      "heard Buck's gun go off at my ear, and Harney's hat tumbled off from his\n",
      "head.  He grabbed his gun and rode straight to the place where we was\n",
      "hid.  But we didn't wait.  We started through the woods on a run.  The\n",
      "woods warn't thick, so I looked over my shoulder to dodge the bullet,\n",
      "and twice I seen Harney cover Buck with his gun; and then he rode away\n",
      "the way he come--to get his hat, I reckon, but I couldn't see.  We never\n",
      "stopped running till we got home.  The old gentleman's eyes blazed a\n",
      "minute--'twas pleasure, mainly, I judged--then his face sort of smoothed\n",
      "down, and he says, kind of gentle:\n",
      "\n",
      "\"I don't like that shooting from behind a bush.  Why didn't you step\n",
      "into the road, my boy?\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"The Shepherdsons don't, father.  They always take advantage.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "Miss Charlotte she held her head up like a queen while Buck was telling\n",
      "his tale, and her nostrils spread and her eyes snapped.  The two young\n",
      "men looked dark, but never said nothing.  Miss Sophia she turned pale,\n",
      "but the color come back when she found the man warn't hurt.\n",
      "\n",
      "Soon as I could get Buck down by the corn-cribs under the trees by\n",
      "ourselves, I says:\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Did you want to kill him, Buck?\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Well, I bet I did.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"What did he do to you?\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Him?  He never done nothing to me.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Well, then, what did you want to kill him for?\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Why, nothing--only it's on account of the feud.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"What's a feud?\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Why, where was you raised?  Don't you know what a feud is?\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Never heard of it before--tell me about it.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Well,\" says Buck, \"a feud is this way:  A man has a quarrel with\n",
      "another man, and kills him; then that other man's brother kills _him_;\n",
      "then the other brothers, on both sides, goes for one another; then the\n",
      "_cousins_ chip in--and by and by everybody's killed off, and there ain't\n",
      "no more feud.  But it's kind of slow, and takes a long time.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Has this one been going on long, Buck?\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Well, I should _reckon_!  It started thirty year ago, or som'ers along\n",
      "there.  There was trouble 'bout something, and then a lawsuit to settle\n",
      "it; and the suit went agin one of the men, and so he up and shot the\n",
      "man that won the suit--which he would naturally do, of course.  Anybody\n",
      "would.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"What was the trouble about, Buck?--land?\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"I reckon maybe--I don't know.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Well, who done the shooting?  Was it a Grangerford or a Shepherdson?\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Laws, how do I know?  It was so long ago.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Don't anybody know?\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Oh, yes, pa knows, I reckon, and some of the other old people; but they\n",
      "don't know now what the row was about in the first place.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Has there been many killed, Buck?\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Yes; right smart chance of funerals.  But they don't always kill.  Pa's\n",
      "got a few buckshot in him; but he don't mind it 'cuz he don't weigh\n",
      "much, anyway.  Bob's been carved up some with a bowie, and Tom's been\n",
      "hurt once or twice.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Has anybody been killed this year, Buck?\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Yes; we got one and they got one.  'Bout three months ago my cousin\n",
      "Bud, fourteen year old, was riding through the woods on t'other side\n",
      "of the river, and didn't have no weapon with him, which was blame'\n",
      "foolishness, and in a lonesome place he hears a horse a-coming behind\n",
      "him, and sees old Baldy Shepherdson a-linkin' after him with his gun in\n",
      "his hand and his white hair a-flying in the wind; and 'stead of jumping\n",
      "off and taking to the brush, Bud 'lowed he could out-run him; so they\n",
      "had it, nip and tuck, for five mile or more, the old man a-gaining all\n",
      "the time; so at last Bud seen it warn't any use, so he stopped and faced\n",
      "around so as to have the bullet holes in front, you know, and the old\n",
      "man he rode up and shot him down.  But he didn't git much chance to\n",
      "enjoy his luck, for inside of a week our folks laid _him_ out.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"I reckon that old man was a coward, Buck.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"I reckon he _warn't_ a coward.  Not by a blame' sight.  There ain't a\n",
      "coward amongst them Shepherdsons--not a one.  And there ain't no cowards\n",
      "amongst the Grangerfords either.  Why, that old man kep' up his end in a\n",
      "fight one day for half an hour against three Grangerfords, and come\n",
      "out winner.  They was all a-horseback; he lit off of his horse and got\n",
      "behind a little woodpile, and kep' his horse before him to stop the\n",
      "bullets; but the Grangerfords stayed on their horses and capered around\n",
      "the old man, and peppered away at him, and he peppered away at them.\n",
      " Him and his horse both went home pretty leaky and crippled, but the\n",
      "Grangerfords had to be _fetched_ home--and one of 'em was dead, and\n",
      "another died the next day.  No, sir; if a body's out hunting for cowards\n",
      "he don't want to fool away any time amongst them Shepherdsons, becuz\n",
      "they don't breed any of that _kind_.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "Next Sunday we all went to church, about three mile, everybody\n",
      "a-horseback. The men took their guns along, so did Buck, and kept\n",
      "them between their knees or stood them handy against the wall.  The\n",
      "Shepherdsons done the same.  It was pretty ornery preaching--all about\n",
      "brotherly love, and such-like tiresomeness; but everybody said it was\n",
      "a good sermon, and they all talked it over going home, and had such\n",
      "a powerful lot to say about faith and good works and free grace and\n",
      "preforeordestination, and I don't know what all, that it did seem to me\n",
      "to be one of the roughest Sundays I had run across yet.\n",
      "\n",
      "About an hour after dinner everybody was dozing around, some in their\n",
      "chairs and some in their rooms, and it got to be pretty dull.  Buck and\n",
      "a dog was stretched out on the grass in the sun sound asleep.  I went up\n",
      "to our room, and judged I would take a nap myself.  I found that sweet\n",
      "Miss Sophia standing in her door, which was next to ours, and she took\n",
      "me in her room and shut the door very soft, and asked me if I liked her,\n",
      "and I said I did; and she asked me if I would do something for her and\n",
      "not tell anybody, and I said I would.  Then she said she'd forgot her\n",
      "Testament, and left it in the seat at church between two other books,\n",
      "and would I slip out quiet and go there and fetch it to her, and not say\n",
      "nothing to nobody.  I said I would. So I slid out and slipped off up the\n",
      "road, and there warn't anybody at the church, except maybe a hog or two,\n",
      "for there warn't any lock on the door, and hogs likes a puncheon floor\n",
      "in summer-time because it's cool.  If you notice, most folks don't go to\n",
      "church only when they've got to; but a hog is different.\n",
      "\n",
      "Says I to myself, something's up; it ain't natural for a girl to be in\n",
      "such a sweat about a Testament.  So I give it a shake, and out drops a\n",
      "little piece of paper with \"HALF-PAST TWO\" wrote on it with a pencil.  I\n",
      "ransacked it, but couldn't find anything else.  I couldn't make anything\n",
      "out of that, so I put the paper in the book again, and when I got home\n",
      "and upstairs there was Miss Sophia in her door waiting for me.  She\n",
      "pulled me in and shut the door; then she looked in the Testament till\n",
      "she found the paper, and as soon as she read it she looked glad; and\n",
      "before a body could think she grabbed me and give me a squeeze, and\n",
      "said I was the best boy in the world, and not to tell anybody.  She was\n",
      "mighty red in the face for a minute, and her eyes lighted up, and it\n",
      "made her powerful pretty.  I was a good deal astonished, but when I got\n",
      "my breath I asked her what the paper was about, and she asked me if I\n",
      "had read it, and I said no, and she asked me if I could read writing,\n",
      "and I told her \"no, only coarse-hand,\" and then she said the paper\n",
      "warn't anything but a book-mark to keep her place, and I might go and\n",
      "play now.\n",
      "\n",
      "I went off down to the river, studying over this thing, and pretty soon\n",
      "I noticed that my nigger was following along behind.  When we was out\n",
      "of sight of the house he looked back and around a second, and then comes\n",
      "a-running, and says:\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Mars Jawge, if you'll come down into de swamp I'll show you a whole\n",
      "stack o' water-moccasins.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "Thinks I, that's mighty curious; he said that yesterday.  He oughter\n",
      "know a body don't love water-moccasins enough to go around hunting for\n",
      "them. What is he up to, anyway?  So I says:\n",
      "\n",
      "\"All right; trot ahead.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "I followed a half a mile; then he struck out over the swamp, and waded\n",
      "ankle deep as much as another half-mile.  We come to a little flat piece\n",
      "of land which was dry and very thick with trees and bushes and vines,\n",
      "and he says:\n",

      "\n",
      "Then he slopped right along and went away, and pretty soon the trees hid\n",
      "him.  I poked into the place a-ways and come to a little open patch\n",
      "as big as a bedroom all hung around with vines, and found a man laying\n",
      "there asleep--and, by jings, it was my old Jim!\n",
      "\n",
      "I waked him up, and I reckoned it was going to be a grand surprise to\n",

      "in the time.  It was a monstrous big river down there--sometimes a mile\n",
      "and a half wide; we run nights, and laid up and hid daytimes; soon as\n",
      "night was most gone we stopped navigating and tied up--nearly always\n",
      "in the dead water under a towhead; and then cut young cottonwoods and\n",
      "willows, and hid the raft with them.  Then we set out the lines.  Next\n",
      "we slid into the river and had a swim, so as to freshen up and cool\n",
      "off; then we set down on the sandy bottom where the water was about knee\n",
      "deep, and watched the daylight come.  Not a sound anywheres--perfectly\n",
      "still--just like the whole world was asleep, only sometimes the bullfrogs\n",
      "a-cluttering, maybe.  The first thing to see, looking away over the\n",
      "water, was a kind of dull line--that was the woods on t'other side; you\n",
      "couldn't make nothing else out; then a pale place in the sky; then more\n",
      "paleness spreading around; then the river softened up away off, and\n",
      "warn't black any more, but gray; you could see little dark spots\n",
      "drifting along ever so far away--trading scows, and such things; and\n",
      "long black streaks--rafts; sometimes you could hear a sweep screaking; or\n",
      "jumbled up voices, it was so still, and sounds come so far; and by and\n",
      "by you could see a streak on the water which you know by the look of the\n",
      "streak that there's a snag there in a swift current which breaks on it\n",
      "and makes that streak look that way; and you see the mist curl up off\n",
      "of the water, and the east reddens up, and the river, and you make out a\n",
      "log-cabin in the edge of the woods, away on the bank on t'other side of\n",
      "the river, being a woodyard, likely, and piled by them cheats so you can\n",
      "throw a dog through it anywheres; then the nice breeze springs up, and\n",
      "comes fanning you from over there, so cool and fresh and sweet to smell\n",
      "on account of the woods and the flowers; but sometimes not that way,\n",
      "because they've left dead fish laying around, gars and such, and they\n",
      "do get pretty rank; and next you've got the full day, and everything\n",
      "smiling in the sun, and the song-birds just going it!\n",
      "\n",
      "A little smoke couldn't be noticed now, so we would take some fish off\n",
      "of the lines and cook up a hot breakfast.  And afterwards we would watch\n",
      "the lonesomeness of the river, and kind of lazy along, and by and by\n",
      "lazy off to sleep.  Wake up by and by, and look to see what done it, and\n",
      "maybe see a steamboat coughing along up-stream, so far off towards the\n",
      "other side you couldn't tell nothing about her only whether she was\n",
      "a stern-wheel or side-wheel; then for about an hour there wouldn't be\n",
      "nothing to hear nor nothing to see--just solid lonesomeness.  Next\n",
      "you'd see a raft sliding by, away off yonder, and maybe a galoot on it\n",
      "chopping, because they're most always doing it on a raft; you'd see the\n",
      "axe flash and come down--you don't hear nothing; you see that axe go\n",
      "up again, and by the time it's above the man's head then you hear the\n",
      "_k'chunk_!--it had took all that time to come over the water.  So we\n",
      "would put in the day, lazying around, listening to the stillness.  Once\n",
      "there was a thick fog, and the rafts and things that went by was beating\n",
      "tin pans so the steamboats wouldn't run over them.  A scow or a\n",
      "raft went by so close we could hear them talking and cussing and\n",

      "her to; then we lit the pipes, and dangled our legs in the water, and\n",
      "talked about all kinds of things--we was always naked, day and night,\n",
      "whenever the mosquitoes would let us--the new clothes Buck's folks made\n",

      "you could see a spark or two--on a raft or a scow, you know; and maybe\n",
      "you could hear a fiddle or a song coming over from one of them crafts.\n",
      "It's lovely to live on a raft.  We had the sky up there, all speckled\n",

      "against it, because I've seen a frog lay most as many, so of course it\n",
      "could be done. We used to watch the stars that fell, too, and see them\n",

      "dark, and now and then she would belch a whole world of sparks up out\n",
      "of her chimbleys, and they would rain down in the river and look awful\n",
      "pretty; then she would turn a corner and her lights would wink out and\n",
      "her powwow shut off and leave the river still again; and by and by her\n",
      "waves would get to us, a long time after she was gone, and joggle the\n",

      "one-horse place on the river, forty-four mile below Orleans.  Pa was\n",
      "pretty poor, and had some debts; so when he'd squared up there warn't\n",
      "nothing left but sixteen dollars and our nigger, Jim.  That warn't\n",
      "enough to take us fourteen hundred mile, deck passage nor no other way.\n",
      " Well, when the river rose pa had a streak of luck one day; he ketched\n",
      "this piece of a raft; so we reckoned we'd go down to Orleans on it.\n",
      " Pa's luck didn't hold out; a steamboat run over the forrard corner of\n",
      "the raft one night, and we all went overboard and dove under the wheel;\n",
      "Jim and me come up all right, but pa was drunk, and Ike was only four\n",
      "years old, so they never come up no more.  Well, for the next day or\n",
      "two we had considerable trouble, because people was always coming out in\n",
      "skiffs and trying to take Jim away from me, saying they believed he was\n",
      "a runaway nigger.  We don't run daytimes no more now; nights they don't\n",

      "\n",
      "\"Leave me alone to cipher out a way so we can run in the daytime if we\n",

      "that town yonder in daylight--it mightn't be healthy.\"\n",

      "Towards night it begun to darken up and look like rain; the heat\n",
      "lightning was squirting around low down in the sky, and the leaves was\n",
      "beginning to shiver--it was going to be pretty ugly, it was easy to see\n",
      "that.  So the duke and the king went to overhauling our wigwam, to see\n",
      "what the beds was like.  My bed was a straw tick better than Jim's,\n",
      "which was a corn-shuck tick; there's always cobs around about in a shuck\n",
      "tick, and they poke into you and hurt; and when you roll over the dry\n",
      "shucks sound like you was rolling over in a pile of dead leaves; it\n",
      "makes such a rustling that you wake up.  Well, the duke allowed he would\n",
      "take my bed; but the king allowed he wouldn't.  He says:\n",

      "\n",
      "\"'Tis my fate to be always ground into the mire under the iron heel of\n",

      "a mile out, all right.  When we was three-quarters of a mile below we\n",
      "hoisted up our signal lantern; and about ten o'clock it come on to rain\n",
      "and blow and thunder and lighten like everything; so the king told us\n",
      "to both stay on watch till the weather got better; then him and the duke\n",
      "crawled into the wigwam and turned in for the night.  It was my watch\n",
      "below till twelve, but I wouldn't a turned in anyway if I'd had a bed,\n",
      "because a body don't see such a storm as that every day in the week, not\n",
      "by a long sight.  My souls, how the wind did scream along!  And every\n",
      "second or two there'd come a glare that lit up the white-caps for a half\n",
      "a mile around, and you'd see the islands looking dusty through the rain,\n",
      "and the trees thrashing around in the wind; then comes a H-WHACK!--bum!\n",
      "bum! bumble-umble-um-bum-bum-bum-bum--and the thunder would go rumbling\n",
      "and grumbling away, and quit--and then RIP comes another flash and\n",
      "another sockdolager.  The waves most washed me off the raft sometimes,\n",
      "but I hadn't any clothes on, and didn't mind.  We didn't have no trouble\n",
      "about snags; the lightning was glaring and flittering around so constant\n",

      "that and miss them.\n",
      "\n",
      "I had the middle watch, you know, but I was pretty sleepy by that time,\n",
      "so Jim he said he would stand the first half of it for me; he was always\n",
      "mighty good that way, Jim was.  I crawled into the wigwam, but the king\n",
      "and the duke had their legs sprawled around so there warn't no show for\n",
      "me; so I laid outside--I didn't mind the rain, because it was warm, and\n",
      "the waves warn't running so high now.  About two they come up again,\n",
      "though, and Jim was going to call me; but he changed his mind, because\n",
      "he reckoned they warn't high enough yet to do any harm; but he was\n",
      "mistaken about that, for pretty soon all of a sudden along comes a\n",

      " He was the easiest nigger to laugh that ever was, anyway.\n",
      "\n",
      "I took the watch, and Jim he laid down and snored away; and by and by\n",
      "the storm let up for good and all; and the first cabin-light that showed\n",

      "everywheres, feeding out of the wagon-troughs and stomping to keep\n",
      "off the flies.  There was sheds made out of poles and roofed over with\n",

      "\n",
      "The preaching was going on under the same kinds of sheds, only they was\n",
      "bigger and held crowds of people.  The benches was made out of outside\n",
      "slabs of logs, with holes bored in the round side to drive sticks into\n",
      "for legs. They didn't have no backs.  The preachers had high platforms\n",
      "to stand on at one end of the sheds.  The women had on sun-bonnets;\n",
      "and some had linsey-woolsey frocks, some gingham ones, and a few of the\n",
      "young ones had on calico.  Some of the young men was barefooted, and\n",
      "some of the children didn't have on any clothes but just a tow-linen\n",

      "he lined out two more for them to sing--and so on.  The people woke up\n",
      "more and more, and sung louder and louder; and towards the end some\n",
      "begun to groan, and some begun to shout.  Then the preacher begun to\n",
      "preach, and begun in earnest, too; and went weaving first to one side of\n",
      "the platform and then the other, and then a-leaning down over the front\n",
      "of it, with his arms and his body going all the time, and shouting his\n",
      "words out with all his might; and every now and then he would hold up\n",
      "his Bible and spread it open, and kind of pass it around this way and\n",
      "that, shouting, \"It's the brazen serpent in the wilderness!  Look upon\n",
      "it and live!\"  And people would shout out, \"Glory!--A-a-_men_!\"  And so\n",
      "he went on, and the people groaning and crying and saying amen:\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Oh, come to the mourners' bench! come, black with sin! (_Amen_!) come,\n",

      "bench, with the tears running down their faces; and when all the\n",
      "mourners had got up there to the front benches in a crowd, they sung and\n",

      "told them he was a pirate--been a pirate for thirty years out in the\n",
      "Indian Ocean--and his crew was thinned out considerable last spring in\n",
      "a fight, and he was home now to take out some fresh men, and thanks to\n",

      "without a cent, and he was glad of it; it was the blessedest thing that\n",
      "ever happened to him, because he was a changed man now, and happy for\n",
      "the first time in his life; and, poor as he was, he was going to start\n",
      "right off and work his way back to the Indian Ocean, and put in the rest\n",
      "of his life trying to turn the pirates into the true path; for he could\n",
      "do it better than anybody else, being acquainted with all pirate crews\n",
      "in that ocean; and though it would take him a long time to get there\n",
      "without money, he would get there anyway, and every time he convinced\n",
      "a pirate he would say to him, \"Don't you thank me, don't you give me no\n",
      "credit; it all belongs to them dear people in Pokeville camp-meeting,\n",
      "natural brothers and benefactors of the race, and that dear preacher\n",

      "\n",

      "a half a dozen made a jump to do it, but somebody sings out, \"Let _him_\n",
      "pass the hat around!\"  Then everybody said it, the preacher too.\n",
      "\n",
      "So the king went all through the crowd with his hat swabbing his eyes,\n",
      "and blessing the people and praising them and thanking them for being\n",
      "so good to the poor pirates away off there; and every little while the\n",
      "prettiest kind of girls, with the tears running down their cheeks, would\n",
      "up and ask him would he let them kiss him for to remember him by; and he\n",
      "always done it; and some of them he hugged and kissed as many as five or\n",
      "six times--and he was invited to stay a week; and everybody wanted him to\n",
      "live in their houses, and said they'd think it was an honor; but he said\n",
      "as this was the last day of the camp-meeting he couldn't do no good, and\n",
      "besides he was in a sweat to get to the Indian Ocean right off and go to\n",
      "work on the pirates.\n",
      "\n",
      "When we got back to the raft and he come to count up he found he had\n",
      "collected eighty-seven dollars and seventy-five cents.  And then he had\n",
      "fetched away a three-gallon jug of whisky, too, that he found under a\n",
      "wagon when he was starting home through the woods.  The king said,\n",
      "take it all around, it laid over any day he'd ever put in in the\n",

      "The duke was thinking _he'd_ been doing pretty well till the king come\n",
      "to show up, but after that he didn't think so so much.  He had set\n",
      "up and printed off two little jobs for farmers in that\n",

      "had got in ten dollars' worth of advertisements for the paper, which he\n",

      "in three subscriptions for half a dollar apiece on condition of them\n",
      "paying him in advance; they were going to pay in cordwood and onions as\n",
      "usual, but he said he had just bought the concern and knocked down the\n",
      "price as low as he could afford it, and was going to run it for cash.\n",
      " He set up a little piece of poetry, which he made, himself, out of\n",
      "his own head--three verses--kind of sweet and saddish--the name of it was,\n",
      "\"Yes, crush, cold world, this breaking heart\"--and he left that all set\n",
      "up and ready to print in the paper, and didn't charge nothing for it.\n",
      " Well, he took in nine dollars and a half, and said he'd done a pretty\n",
      "square day's work for it.\n",
      "\n",
      "Then he showed us another little job he'd printed and hadn't charged\n",
      "for, because it was for us.  It had a picture of a runaway nigger with\n",
      "a bundle on a stick over his shoulder, and \"$200 reward\" under it.  The\n",

      "he run away from St. Jacques' plantation, forty mile below New Orleans,\n",
      "last winter, and likely went north, and whoever would catch him and send\n",

      "he laid still; he was dead.  Then they pulled his daughter away from\n",

      "heads to show they understood, and stooping a little and resting their\n",
      "hands on their thighs to watch him mark the places on the ground with\n",

      "mob, screaming and trying to get out of the way; and every window along\n",
      "the road was full of women's heads, and there was nigger boys in every\n",

      "They swarmed up in front of Sherburn's palings as thick as they could\n",

      "down the fence!\"  Then there was a racket of ripping and tearing and\n",

      "I went to the circus and loafed around the back side till the watchman\n",

      "dollars, and just littered with diamonds.  It was a powerful fine sight;\n",

      "come to a standstill.  Then the people begun to holler at him and make\n",
      "fun of him, and that made him mad, and he begun to rip and tear; so that\n",
      "stirred up the people, and a lot of men begun to pile down off of the\n",
      "benches and swarm towards the ring, saying, \"Knock him down! throw him\n",

      "with two circus men hanging on to his bridle trying to hold him, and the\n",
      "drunk man hanging on to his neck, and his heels flying in the air every\n",

      "a-reeling this way and that; and the next minute he sprung up and\n",
      "dropped the bridle and stood! and the horse a-going like a house afire\n",
      "too.  He just stood up there, a-sailing around as easy and comfortable\n",

      "ever saw, and he lit into that horse with his whip and made him fairly\n",

      "nigger, you know. So the duke said it _was_ kind of hard to have to lay\n",
      "roped all day, and he'd cipher out some way to get around it.\n",
      "\n",
      "He was uncommon bright, the duke was, and he soon struck it.  He dressed\n",
      "Jim up in King Lear's outfit--it was a long curtain-calico gown, and a\n",
      "white horse-hair wig and whiskers; and then he took his theater paint\n",
      "and painted Jim's face and hands and ears and neck all over a dead,\n",
      "dull, solid blue, like a man that's been drownded nine days.  Blamed if\n",

      "\n",

      "better than lying tied a couple of years every day, and trembling all\n",
      "over every time there was a sound.  The duke told him to make himself\n",
      "free and easy, and if anybody ever come meddling around, he must hop\n",
      "out of the wigwam, and carry on a little, and fetch a howl or two like\n",
      "a wild beast, and he reckoned they would light out and leave him alone.\n",
      " Which was sound enough judgment; but you take the average man, and he\n",

      "on, and he told me to put mine on.  I done it, of course.  The king's\n",

      "and making no more sound than a cat.  He never spoke; he moved people\n",
      "around, he squeezed in late ones, he opened up passageways, and done\n",
      "it with nods, and signs with his hands.  Then he took his place over\n",

      "They had borrowed a melodeum--a sick one; and when everything was ready\n",

      "opened up, slow and solemn, and begun to talk; and straight off the most\n",
      "outrageous row busted out in the cellar a body ever heard; it was only\n",
      "one dog, but he made a most powerful racket, and he kept it up right\n",
      "along; the parson he had to stand there, over the coffin, and wait--you\n",
      "couldn't hear yourself think.  It was right down awkward, and nobody\n",

      "\"Don't you worry--just depend on me.\"  Then he stooped down and begun\n",
      "to glide along the wall, just his shoulders showing over the people's\n",
      "heads.  So he glided along, and the powwow and racket getting more and\n",
      "more outrageous all the time; and at last, when he had gone around two\n",
      "sides of the room, he disappears down cellar.  Then in about two seconds\n",
      "we heard a whack, and the dog he finished up with a most amazing howl or\n",
      "two, and then everything was dead still, and the parson begun his solemn\n",
      "talk where he left off.  In a minute or two here comes this undertaker's\n",
      "back and shoulders gliding along the wall again; and so he glided and\n",
      "glided around three sides of the room, and then rose up, and shaded his\n",
      "mouth with his hands, and stretched his neck out towards the preacher,\n",
      "over the people's heads, and says, in a kind of a coarse whisper, \"_He\n",
      "had a rat_!\"  Then he drooped down and glided along the wall again to\n",
      "his place.  You could see it was a great satisfaction to the people,\n",
      "because naturally they wanted to know.  A little thing like that don't\n",
      "cost nothing, and it's just the little things that makes a man to be\n",

      "coffin with his screw-driver.  I was in a sweat then, and watched him\n",
      "pretty keen. But he never meddled at all; just slid the lid along as\n",
      "soft as mush, and screwed it down tight and fast.  So there I was!  I\n",
      "didn't know whether the money was in there or not.  So, says I, s'pose\n",

      "just as sorry as I can be; but I done the best I could; I did honest.  I\n",
      "come nigh getting caught, and I had to shove it into the first place I\n",

      "\n",
      "\"Oh, stop blaming yourself--it's too bad to do it, and I won't allow\n",

      "for a minute I didn't say nothing; then I says:\n",
      "\n",
      "\"I'd ruther not _tell_ you where I put it, Miss Mary Jane, if you don't\n",

      "to her I see the water come into her eyes, too; and she shook me by the\n",

      "\n",
      "\"_Good_-bye.  I'm going to do everything just as you've told me; and if\n",

      "\n",
      "Pray for me!  I reckoned if she knowed me she'd take a job that was more\n",
      "nearer her size.  But I bet she done it, just the same--she was just that\n",
      "kind.  She had the grit to pray for Judus if she took the notion--there\n",
      "warn't no back-down to her, I judge.  You may say what you want to, but\n",
      "in my opinion she had more sand in her than any girl I ever see; in\n",

      "ain't no flattery.  And when it comes to beauty--and goodness, too--she\n",
      "lays over them all.  I hain't ever seen her since that time that I see\n",
      "her go out of that door; no, I hain't ever seen her since, but I reckon\n",
      "I've thought of her a many and a many a million times, and of her saying\n",

      "they had me up to tell what I knowed.  The king he give me a left-handed\n",
      "look out of the corner of his eye, and so I knowed enough to talk on the\n",
      "right side.  I begun to tell about Sheffield, and how we lived there,\n",
      "and all about the English Wilkses, and so on; but I didn't get pretty\n",
      "fur till the doctor begun to laugh; and Levi Bell, the lawyer, says:\n",

      "\"If you'd been in town at first, Levi Bell--\" The king broke in and\n",
      "reached out his hand, and says:\n",

      "\n",
      "So they got some paper and a pen, and the king he set down and twisted\n",

      "and then they give the pen to the duke--and then for the first time the\n",

      "\n",
      "\"Well, it beats _me_\"--and snaked a lot of old letters out of his pocket,\n",
      "and examined them, and then examined the old man's writing, and then\n",
      "_them_ again; and then says:  \"These old letters is from Harvey Wilks;\n",

      "you, to see how the lawyer had took them in), \"and here's _this_ old\n",

      "The lawyer done it, and says:\n",
      "\n",
      "\"I believe it's so--and if it ain't so, there's a heap stronger\n",
      "resemblance than I'd noticed before, anyway.  Well, well, well!  I\n",
      "thought we was right on the track of a solution, but it's gone to grass,\n",
      "partly.  But anyway, one thing is proved--_these_ two ain't either of 'em\n",

      "\n",
      "Well, what do you think?  That muleheaded old fool wouldn't give in\n",
      "_then_! Indeed he wouldn't.  Said it warn't no fair test.  Said his\n",

      "to write--_he_ see William was going to play one of his jokes the minute\n",
      "he put the pen to paper.  And so he warmed up and went warbling and\n",
      "warbling right along till he was actuly beginning to believe what he was\n",
      "saying _himself_; but pretty soon the new gentleman broke in, and says:\n",
      "\n",
      "\"I've thought of something.  Is there anybody here that helped to lay\n",
      "out my br--helped to lay out the late Peter Wilks for burying?\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Yes,\" says somebody, \"me and Ab Turner done it.  We're both here.\"\n",

      "Blamed if the king didn't have to brace up mighty quick, or he'd a\n",
      "squshed down like a bluff bank that the river has cut under, it took\n",
      "him so sudden; and, mind you, it was a thing that was calculated to make\n",
      "most _anybody_ sqush to get fetched such a solid one as that without any\n",
      "notice, because how was _he_ going to know what was tattooed on the man?\n",
      " He whitened a little; he couldn't help it; and it was mighty still in\n",
      "there, and everybody bending a little forwards and gazing at him.  Says\n",
      "I to myself, _now_ he'll throw up the sponge--there ain't no more use.\n",
      " Well, did he?  A body can't hardly believe it, but he didn't.  I reckon\n",
      "he thought he'd keep the thing up till he tired them people out, so\n",
      "they'd thin out, and him and the duke could break loose and get away.\n",
      " Anyway, he set there, and pretty soon he begun to smile, and says:\n",

      "how good it was all this happened so, and how near I come to being lost\n",
      "and going to hell.  And went on thinking.  And got to thinking over our\n",
      "trip down the river; and I see Jim before me all the time:  in the day\n",
      "and in the night-time, sometimes moonlight, sometimes storms, and we\n",
      "a-floating along, talking and singing and laughing.  But somehow I\n",
      "couldn't seem to strike no places to harden me against him, but only the\n",
      "other kind.  I'd see him standing my watch on top of his'n, 'stead of\n",
      "calling me, so I could go on sleeping; and see him how glad he was when\n",
      "I come back out of the fog; and when I come to him again in the swamp,\n",
      "up there where the feud was; and such-like times; and would always call\n",
      "me honey, and pet me and do everything he could think of for me, and how\n",
      "good he always was; and at last I struck the time I saved him by telling\n",
      "the men we had small-pox aboard, and he was so grateful, and said I was\n",
      "the best friend old Jim ever had in the world, and the _only_ one he's\n",
      "got now; and then I happened to look around and see that paper.\n",
      "\n",
      "It was a close place.  I took it up, and held it in my hand.  I was\n",
      "a-trembling, because I'd got to decide, forever, betwixt two things, and\n",
      "I knowed it.  I studied a minute, sort of holding my breath, and then\n",
      "says to myself:\n",
      "\n",
      "\"All right, then, I'll _go_ to hell\"--and tore it up.\n",
      "\n",
      "It was awful thoughts and awful words, but they was said.  And I let\n",
      "them stay said; and never thought no more about reforming.  I shoved the\n",
      "whole thing out of my head, and said I would take up wickedness again,\n",
      "which was in my line, being brung up to it, and the other warn't.  And\n",
      "for a starter I would go to work and steal Jim out of slavery again;\n",
      "and if I could think up anything worse, I would do that, too; because as\n",
      "long as I was in, and in for good, I might as well go the whole hog.\n",
      "\n",
      "Then I set to thinking over how to get at it, and turned over some\n",
      "considerable many ways in my mind; and at last fixed up a plan that\n",
      "suited me.  So then I took the bearings of a woody island that was down\n",
      "the river a piece, and as soon as it was fairly dark I crept out with my\n",
      "raft and went for it, and hid it there, and then turned in.  I slept the\n",
      "night through, and got up before it was light, and had my breakfast,\n",
      "and put on my store clothes, and tied up some others and one thing or\n",
      "another in a bundle, and took the canoe and cleared for shore.  I landed\n",
      "below where I judged was Phelps's place, and hid my bundle in the woods,\n",
      "and then filled up the canoe with water, and loaded rocks into her and\n",
      "sunk her where I could find her again when I wanted her, about a quarter\n",
      "of a mile below a little steam sawmill that was on the bank.\n",
      "\n",
      "Then I struck up the road, and when I passed the mill I see a sign on\n",
      "it, \"Phelps's Sawmill,\" and when I come to the farm-houses, two or\n",
      "three hundred yards further along, I kept my eyes peeled, but didn't\n",
      "see nobody around, though it was good daylight now.  But I didn't mind,\n",
      "because I didn't want to see nobody just yet--I only wanted to get the\n",
      "lay of the land. According to my plan, I was going to turn up there from\n",
      "the village, not from below.  So I just took a look, and shoved along,\n",
      "straight for town. Well, the very first man I see when I got there was\n",
      "the duke.  He was sticking up a bill for the Royal Nonesuch--three-night\n",
      "performance--like that other time.  They had the cheek, them frauds!  I\n",
      "was right on him before I could shirk.  He looked astonished, and says:\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Hel-_lo_!  Where'd _you_ come from?\"  Then he says, kind of glad and\n",
      "eager, \"Where's the raft?--got her in a good place?\"\n",
      "\n",
      "I says:\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Why, that's just what I was going to ask your grace.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "Then he didn't look so joyful, and says:\n",
      "\n",
      "\"What was your idea for asking _me_?\" he says.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Well,\" I says, \"when I see the king in that doggery yesterday I says\n",
      "to myself, we can't get him home for hours, till he's soberer; so I went\n",
      "a-loafing around town to put in the time and wait.  A man up and offered\n",
      "me ten cents to help him pull a skiff over the river and back to fetch\n",
      "a sheep, and so I went along; but when we was dragging him to the boat,\n",
      "and the man left me a-holt of the rope and went behind him to shove him\n",
      "along, he was too strong for me and jerked loose and run, and we after\n",
      "him.  We didn't have no dog, and so we had to chase him all over the\n",
      "country till we tired him out.  We never got him till dark; then we\n",
      "fetched him over, and I started down for the raft.  When I got there and\n",
      "see it was gone, I says to myself, 'They've got into trouble and had to\n",
      "leave; and they've took my nigger, which is the only nigger I've got in\n",
      "the world, and now I'm in a strange country, and ain't got no property\n",
      "no more, nor nothing, and no way to make my living;' so I set down and\n",
      "cried.  I slept in the woods all night.  But what _did_ become of the\n",
      "raft, then?--and Jim--poor Jim!\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Blamed if I know--that is, what's become of the raft.  That old fool had\n",
      "made a trade and got forty dollars, and when we found him in the doggery\n",
      "the loafers had matched half-dollars with him and got every cent but\n",
      "what he'd spent for whisky; and when I got him home late last night and\n",
      "found the raft gone, we said, 'That little rascal has stole our raft and\n",
      "shook us, and run off down the river.'\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"I wouldn't shake my _nigger_, would I?--the only nigger I had in the\n",
      "world, and the only property.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"We never thought of that.  Fact is, I reckon we'd come to consider him\n",
      "_our_ nigger; yes, we did consider him so--goodness knows we had trouble\n",
      "enough for him.  So when we see the raft was gone and we flat broke,\n",
      "there warn't anything for it but to try the Royal Nonesuch another\n",
      "shake. And I've pegged along ever since, dry as a powder-horn.  Where's\n",
      "that ten cents? Give it here.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "I had considerable money, so I give him ten cents, but begged him to\n",
      "spend it for something to eat, and give me some, because it was all the\n",
      "money I had, and I hadn't had nothing to eat since yesterday.  He never\n",
      "said nothing.  The next minute he whirls on me and says:\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Do you reckon that nigger would blow on us?  We'd skin him if he done\n",
      "that!\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"How can he blow?  Hain't he run off?\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"No!  That old fool sold him, and never divided with me, and the money's\n",
      "gone.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"_Sold_ him?\"  I says, and begun to cry; \"why, he was _my_ nigger, and\n",
      "that was my money.  Where is he?--I want my nigger.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Well, you can't _get_ your nigger, that's all--so dry up your\n",
      "blubbering. Looky here--do you think _you'd_ venture to blow on us?\n",
      " Blamed if I think I'd trust you.  Why, if you _was_ to blow on us--\"\n",
      "\n",
      "He stopped, but I never see the duke look so ugly out of his eyes\n",
      "before. I went on a-whimpering, and says:\n",
      "\n",
      "\"I don't want to blow on nobody; and I ain't got no time to blow, nohow.\n",
      "I got to turn out and find my nigger.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "He looked kinder bothered, and stood there with his bills fluttering on\n",
      "his arm, thinking, and wrinkling up his forehead.  At last he says:\n",
      "\n",
      "\"I'll tell you something.  We got to be here three days.  If you'll\n",
      "promise you won't blow, and won't let the nigger blow, I'll tell you\n",
      "where to find him.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "So I promised, and he says:\n",
      "\n",
      "\"A farmer by the name of Silas Ph--\" and then he stopped.  You see, he\n",
      "started to tell me the truth; but when he stopped that way, and begun to\n",
      "study and think again, I reckoned he was changing his mind.  And so he\n",
      "was. He wouldn't trust me; he wanted to make sure of having me out of\n",
      "the way the whole three days.  So pretty soon he says:\n",
      "\n",
      "\"The man that bought him is named Abram Foster--Abram G. Foster--and he\n",
      "lives forty mile back here in the country, on the road to Lafayette.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"All right,\" I says, \"I can walk it in three days.  And I'll start this\n",
      "very afternoon.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"No you wont, you'll start _now_; and don't you lose any time about it,\n",
      "neither, nor do any gabbling by the way.  Just keep a tight tongue in\n",
      "your head and move right along, and then you won't get into trouble with\n",
      "_us_, d'ye hear?\"\n",
      "\n",
      "That was the order I wanted, and that was the one I played for.  I\n",
      "wanted to be left free to work my plans.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"So clear out,\" he says; \"and you can tell Mr. Foster whatever you want\n",
      "to. Maybe you can get him to believe that Jim _is_ your nigger--some\n",
      "idiots don't require documents--leastways I've heard there's such down\n",
      "South here.  And when you tell him the handbill and the reward's bogus,\n",
      "maybe he'll believe you when you explain to him what the idea was for\n",
      "getting 'em out.  Go 'long now, and tell him anything you want to; but\n",
      "mind you don't work your jaw any _between_ here and there.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "So I left, and struck for the back country.  I didn't look around, but I\n",
      "kinder felt like he was watching me.  But I knowed I could tire him out\n",
      "at that.  I went straight out in the country as much as a mile before\n",
      "I stopped; then I doubled back through the woods towards Phelps'.  I\n",
      "reckoned I better start in on my plan straight off without fooling\n",
      "around, because I wanted to stop Jim's mouth till these fellows could\n",
      "get away.  I didn't want no trouble with their kind.  I'd seen all I\n",

      "we can't let you walk.  And, besides, I've already told 'em to put on\n",
      "another plate when I see you coming; so you mustn't disappoint us.  Come\n",
      "right in and make yourself at home.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "So Tom he thanked them very hearty and handsome, and let himself be\n",
      "persuaded, and come in; and when he was in he said he was a stranger\n",
      "from Hicksville, Ohio, and his name was William Thompson--and he made\n",
      "another bow.\n",
      "\n",
      "Well, he run on, and on, and on, making up stuff about Hicksville and\n",
      "everybody in it he could invent, and I getting a little nervious, and\n",
      "wondering how this was going to help me out of my scrape; and at last,\n",
      "still talking along, he reached over and kissed Aunt Sally right on the\n",
      "mouth, and then settled back again in his chair comfortable, and was\n",
      "going on talking; but she jumped up and wiped it off with the back of\n",
      "her hand, and says:\n",
      "\n",
      "\"You owdacious puppy!\"\n",
      "\n",
      "He looked kind of hurt, and says:\n",
      "\n",

      "\n",
      "\"You're s'rp--Why, what do you reckon I am?  I've a good notion to take\n",
      "and--Say, what do you mean by kissing me?\"\n",
      "\n",
      "He looked kind of humble, and says:\n",
      "\n",
      "\"I didn't mean nothing, m'am.  I didn't mean no harm.  I--I--thought you'd\n",
      "like it.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Why, you born fool!\"  She took up the spinning stick, and it looked\n",
      "like it was all she could do to keep from giving him a crack with it.\n",
      " \"What made you think I'd like it?\"\n",
      "\n",

      "\n",
      "\"Why, everybody.  They all said so, m'am.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "It was all she could do to hold in; and her eyes snapped, and her\n",

      "\"Who's 'everybody'?  Out with their names, or ther'll be an idiot\n",
      "short.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "He got up and looked distressed, and fumbled his hat, and says:\n",
      "\n",
      "\"I'm sorry, and I warn't expecting it.  They told me to.  They all told\n",
      "me to.  They all said, kiss her; and said she'd like it.  They all said\n",

      "won't, honest.\"\n",

      "\"You won't, won't you?  Well, I sh'd _reckon_ you won't!\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"No'm, I'm honest about it; I won't ever do it again--till you ask me.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Till I _ask_ you!  Well, I never see the beat of it in my born days!\n",
      " I lay you'll be the Methusalem-numskull of creation before ever I ask\n",
      "you--or the likes of you.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Well,\" he says, \"it does surprise me so.  I can't make it out, somehow.\n",
      "They said you would, and I thought you would.  But--\" He stopped and\n",
      "looked around slow, like he wished he could run across a friendly eye\n",
      "somewheres, and fetched up on the old gentleman's, and says, \"Didn't\n",

      "\"Why, no; I--I--well, no, I b'lieve I didn't.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "Then he looks on around the same way to me, and says:\n",

      "\n",

      "\n",
      "\"No, not till you've asked me first.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "So she didn't lose no time, but asked him; and hugged him and kissed\n",

      "\n",
      "\"Why, dear me, I never see such a surprise.  We warn't looking for _you_\n",

      "come, too; so, coming down the river, me and Tom thought it would be a\n",
      "first-rate surprise for him to come here to the house first, and for me\n",
      "to by and by tag along and drop in, and let on to be a stranger.  But it\n",
      "was a mistake, Aunt Sally.  This ain't no healthy place for a stranger\n",
      "to come.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"No--not impudent whelps, Sid.  You ought to had your jaws boxed; I\n",

      "don't mind the terms--I'd be willing to stand a thousand such jokes to\n",
      "have you here. Well, to think of that performance!  I don't deny it, I\n",

      "\n",
      "We had dinner out in that broad open passage betwixt the house and\n",
      "the kitchen; and there was things enough on that table for seven\n",
      "families--and all hot, too; none of your flabby, tough meat that's laid\n",
      "in a cupboard in a damp cellar all night and tastes like a hunk of\n",
      "old cold cannibal in the morning.  Uncle Silas he asked a pretty long\n",
      "blessing over it, but it was worth it; and it didn't cool it a bit,\n",
      "neither, the way I've seen them kind of interruptions do lots of times.\n",
      " There was a considerable good deal of talk all the afternoon, and me\n",
      "and Tom was on the lookout all the time; but it warn't no use, they\n",
      "didn't happen to say nothing about any runaway nigger, and we was afraid\n",
      "to try to work up to it.  But at supper, at night, one of the little\n",
      "boys says:\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Pa, mayn't Tom and Sid and me go to the show?\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"No,\" says the old man, \"I reckon there ain't going to be any; and you\n",
      "couldn't go if there was; because the runaway nigger told Burton and\n",
      "me all about that scandalous show, and Burton said he would tell the\n",
      "people; so I reckon they've drove the owdacious loafers out of town\n",
      "before this time.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "So there it was!--but I couldn't help it.  Tom and me was to sleep in the\n",
      "same room and bed; so, being tired, we bid good-night and went up to\n",
      "bed right after supper, and clumb out of the window and down the\n",
      "lightning-rod, and shoved for the town; for I didn't believe anybody was\n",
      "going to give the king and the duke a hint, and so if I didn't hurry up\n",
      "and give them one they'd get into trouble sure.\n",
      "\n",
      "On the road Tom he told me all about how it was reckoned I was murdered,\n",
      "and how pap disappeared pretty soon, and didn't come back no more, and\n",
      "what a stir there was when Jim run away; and I told Tom all about our\n",
      "Royal Nonesuch rapscallions, and as much of the raft voyage as I had\n",
      "time to; and as we struck into the town and up through the the middle of\n",
      "it--it was as much as half-after eight, then--here comes a raging rush of\n",
      "people with torches, and an awful whooping and yelling, and banging tin\n",
      "pans and blowing horns; and we jumped to one side to let them go by;\n",
      "and as they went by I see they had the king and the duke astraddle of a\n",
      "rail--that is, I knowed it _was_ the king and the duke, though they was\n",
      "all over tar and feathers, and didn't look like nothing in the\n",
      "world that was human--just looked like a couple of monstrous big\n",
      "soldier-plumes.  Well, it made me sick to see it; and I was sorry for\n",
      "them poor pitiful rascals, it seemed like I couldn't ever feel any\n",
      "hardness against them any more in the world.  It was a dreadful thing to\n",
      "see.  Human beings _can_ be awful cruel to one another.\n",
      "\n",
      "We see we was too late--couldn't do no good.  We asked some stragglers\n",
      "about it, and they said everybody went to the show looking very\n",
      "innocent; and laid low and kept dark till the poor old king was in the\n",
      "middle of his cavortings on the stage; then somebody give a signal, and\n",
      "the house rose up and went for them.\n",
      "\n",
      "So we poked along back home, and I warn't feeling so brash as I was\n",
      "before, but kind of ornery, and humble, and to blame, somehow--though\n",
      "I hadn't done nothing.  But that's always the way; it don't make no\n",
      "difference whether you do right or wrong, a person's conscience ain't\n",
      "got no sense, and just goes for him anyway.  If I had a yaller dog that\n",
      "didn't know no more than a person's conscience does I would pison him.\n",

      "WE stopped talking, and got to thinking.  By and by Tom says:\n",

      "\"Looky here, Huck, what fools we are to not think of it before!  I bet I\n",

      "\n",
      "\"No!  Where?\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"In that hut down by the ash-hopper.  Why, looky here.  When we was at\n",

      "\"Yes.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"What did you think the vittles was for?\"\n",

      "\n",

      "about a dog not eating watermelon.  It shows how a body can see and\n",
      "don't see at the same time.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Well, the nigger unlocked the padlock when he went in, and he locked it\n",
      "again when he came out.  He fetched uncle a key about the time we got up\n",
      "from table--same key, I bet.  Watermelon shows man, lock shows prisoner;\n",
      "and it ain't likely there's two prisoners on such a little plantation,\n",
      "and where the people's all so kind and good.  Jim's the prisoner.  All\n",
      "right--I'm glad we found it out detective fashion; I wouldn't give shucks\n",
      "for any other way.  Now you work your mind, and study out a plan to\n",

      "the best.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "What a head for just a boy to have!  If I had Tom Sawyer's head I\n",
      "wouldn't trade it off to be a duke, nor mate of a steamboat, nor clown\n",
      "in a circus, nor nothing I can think of.  I went to thinking out a plan,\n",
      "but only just to be doing something; I knowed very well where the right\n",
      "plan was going to come from.  Pretty soon Tom says:\n",
      "\n",

      "Then get up my canoe to-morrow night, and fetch my raft over from the\n",
      "island.  Then the first dark night that comes steal the key out of the\n",
      "old man's britches after he goes to bed, and shove off down the river\n",
      "on the raft with Jim, hiding daytimes and running nights, the way me and\n",
      "Jim used to do before.  Wouldn't that plan work?\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"_Work_?  Why, cert'nly it would work, like rats a-fighting.  But it's\n",
      "too blame' simple; there ain't nothing _to_ it.  What's the good of a\n",
      "plan that ain't no more trouble than that?  It's as mild as goose-milk.\n",
      " Why, Huck, it wouldn't make no more talk than breaking into a soap\n",
      "factory.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "I never said nothing, because I warn't expecting nothing different; but\n",
      "I knowed mighty well that whenever he got _his_ plan ready it wouldn't\n",
      "have none of them objections to it.\n",
      "\n",
      "And it didn't.  He told me what it was, and I see in a minute it was\n",
      "worth fifteen of mine for style, and would make Jim just as free a man\n",
      "as mine would, and maybe get us all killed besides.  So I was satisfied,\n",
      "and said we would waltz in on it.  I needn't tell what it was here,\n",
      "because I knowed it wouldn't stay the way, it was.  I knowed he would be\n",
      "changing it around every which way as we went along, and heaving in new\n",
      "bullinesses wherever he got a chance.  And that is what he done.\n",
      "\n",
      "Well, one thing was dead sure, and that was that Tom Sawyer was in\n",
      "earnest, and was actuly going to help steal that nigger out of slavery.\n",
      "That was the thing that was too many for me.  Here was a boy that was\n",
      "respectable and well brung up; and had a character to lose; and folks at\n",
      "home that had characters; and he was bright and not leather-headed; and\n",
      "knowing and not ignorant; and not mean, but kind; and yet here he was,\n",
      "without any more pride, or rightness, or feeling, than to stoop to\n",
      "this business, and make himself a shame, and his family a shame,\n",
      "before everybody.  I _couldn't_ understand it no way at all.  It was\n",
      "outrageous, and I knowed I ought to just up and tell him so; and so be\n",
      "his true friend, and let him quit the thing right where he was and save\n",
      "himself. And I _did_ start to tell him; but he shut me up, and says:\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Don't you reckon I know what I'm about?  Don't I generly know what I'm\n",
      "about?\"\n",

      "\"Yes.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"_Well_, then.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "That's all he said, and that's all I said.  It warn't no use to say any\n",
      "more; because when he said he'd do a thing, he always done it.  But I\n",
      "couldn't make out how he was willing to go into this thing; so I just\n",
      "let it go, and never bothered no more about it.  If he was bound to have\n",
      "it so, I couldn't help it.\n",
      "\n",
      "When we got home the house was all dark and still; so we went on down to\n",
      "the hut by the ash-hopper for to examine it.  We went through the yard\n",
      "so as to see what the hounds would do.  They knowed us, and didn't make\n",
      "no more noise than country dogs is always doing when anything comes by\n",
      "in the night.  When we got to the cabin we took a look at the front and\n",
      "the two sides; and on the side I warn't acquainted with--which was the\n",
      "north side--we found a square window-hole, up tolerable high, with just\n",
      "one stout board nailed across it.  I says:\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Here's the ticket.  This hole's big enough for Jim to get through if we\n",
      "wrench off the board.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "Tom says:\n",
      "\n",
      "\"It's as simple as tit-tat-toe, three-in-a-row, and as easy as\n",
      "playing hooky.  I should _hope_ we can find a way that's a little more\n",
      "complicated than _that_, Huck Finn.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Well, then,\" I says, \"how 'll it do to saw him out, the way I done\n",
      "before I was murdered that time?\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"That's more _like_,\" he says.  \"It's real mysterious, and troublesome,\n",
      "and good,\" he says; \"but I bet we can find a way that's twice as long.\n",
      " There ain't no hurry; le's keep on looking around.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "Betwixt the hut and the fence, on the back side, was a lean-to that\n",
      "joined the hut at the eaves, and was made out of plank.  It was as long\n",
      "as the hut, but narrow--only about six foot wide.  The door to it was at\n",
      "the south end, and was padlocked.  Tom he went to the soap-kettle and\n",
      "searched around, and fetched back the iron thing they lift the lid with;\n",
      "so he took it and prized out one of the staples.  The chain fell down,\n",
      "and we opened the door and went in, and shut it, and struck a match,\n",
      "and see the shed was only built against a cabin and hadn't no connection\n",
      "with it; and there warn't no floor to the shed, nor nothing in it but\n",
      "some old rusty played-out hoes and spades and picks and a crippled plow.\n",
      " The match went out, and so did we, and shoved in the staple again, and\n",
      "the door was locked as good as ever. Tom was joyful.  He says;\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Now we're all right.  We'll _dig_ him out.  It 'll take about a week!\"\n",
      "\n",
      "Then we started for the house, and I went in the back door--you only have\n",
      "to pull a buckskin latch-string, they don't fasten the doors--but that\n",
      "warn't romantical enough for Tom Sawyer; no way would do him but he must\n",
      "climb up the lightning-rod.  But after he got up half way about three\n",
      "times, and missed fire and fell every time, and the last time most\n",
      "busted his brains out, he thought he'd got to give it up; but after he\n",
      "was rested he allowed he would give her one more turn for luck, and this\n",
      "time he made the trip.\n",
      "\n",
      "In the morning we was up at break of day, and down to the nigger cabins\n",
      "to pet the dogs and make friends with the nigger that fed Jim--if it\n",
      "_was_ Jim that was being fed.  The niggers was just getting through\n",
      "breakfast and starting for the fields; and Jim's nigger was piling up\n",
      "a tin pan with bread and meat and things; and whilst the others was\n",
      "leaving, the key come from the house.\n",
      "\n",
      "This nigger had a good-natured, chuckle-headed face, and his wool was\n",
      "all tied up in little bunches with thread.  That was to keep witches\n",
      "off.  He said the witches was pestering him awful these nights, and\n",
      "making him see all kinds of strange things, and hear all kinds of\n",
      "strange words and noises, and he didn't believe he was ever witched so\n",
      "long before in his life.  He got so worked up, and got to running on so\n",
      "about his troubles, he forgot all about what he'd been a-going to do.\n",
      " So Tom says:\n",
      "\n",
      "\"What's the vittles for?  Going to feed the dogs?\"\n",
      "\n",
      "The nigger kind of smiled around gradually over his face, like when you\n",
      "heave a brickbat in a mud-puddle, and he says:\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Yes, Mars Sid, A dog.  Cur'us dog, too.  Does you want to go en look at\n",
      "'im?\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Yes.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "I hunched Tom, and whispers:\n",
      "\n",
      "\"You going, right here in the daybreak?  _that_ warn't the plan.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"No, it warn't; but it's the plan _now_.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "So, drat him, we went along, but I didn't like it much.  When we got in\n",
      "we couldn't hardly see anything, it was so dark; but Jim was there, sure\n",
      "enough, and could see us; and he sings out:\n",
      "\n",

      "AS soon as we reckoned everybody was asleep that night we went down the\n",
      "lightning-rod, and shut ourselves up in the lean-to, and got out our\n",
      "pile of fox-fire, and went to work.  We cleared everything out of the\n",
      "way, about four or five foot along the middle of the bottom log.  Tom\n",
      "said he was right behind Jim's bed now, and we'd dig in under it, and\n",
      "when we got through there couldn't nobody in the cabin ever know there\n",
      "was any hole there, because Jim's counter-pin hung down most to the\n",
      "ground, and you'd have to raise it up and look under to see the hole.\n",
      " So we dug and dug with the case-knives till most midnight; and then\n",
      "we was dog-tired, and our hands was blistered, and yet you couldn't see\n",
      "we'd done anything hardly.  At last I says:\n",

      "Tom Sawyer.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "He never said nothing.  But he sighed, and pretty soon he stopped\n",
      "digging, and then for a good little while I knowed that he was thinking.\n",
      "Then he says:\n",
      "\n",
      "\"It ain't no use, Huck, it ain't a-going to work.  If we was prisoners\n",
      "it would, because then we'd have as many years as we wanted, and no\n",
      "hurry; and we wouldn't get but a few minutes to dig, every day, while\n",
      "they was changing watches, and so our hands wouldn't get blistered, and\n",
      "we could keep it up right along, year in and year out, and do it right,\n",
      "and the way it ought to be done.  But _we_ can't fool along; we got to\n",
      "rush; we ain't got no time to spare.  If we was to put in another\n",
      "night this way we'd have to knock off for a week to let our hands get\n",

      "\n",
      "\"Well, then, what we going to do, Tom?\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"I'll tell you.  It ain't right, and it ain't moral, and I wouldn't like\n",
      "it to get out; but there ain't only just the one way:  we got to dig him\n",
      "out with the picks, and _let on_ it's case-knives.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"_Now_ you're _talking_!\"  I says; \"your head gets leveler and leveler\n",

      " When I start in to steal a nigger, or a watermelon, or a Sunday-school\n",
      "book, I ain't no ways particular how it's done so it's done.  What I\n",

      "\n",
      "\"Well,\" he says, \"there's excuse for picks and letting-on in a case like\n",

      "and see the rules broke--because right is right, and wrong is wrong,\n",
      "and a body ain't got no business doing wrong when he ain't ignorant and\n",
      "knows better.  It might answer for _you_ to dig Jim out with a pick,\n",
      "_without_ any letting on, because you don't know no better; but it\n",
      "wouldn't for me, because I do know better.  Gimme a case-knife.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "He had his own by him, but I handed him mine.  He flung it down, and\n",

      "\n",
      "\"Gimme a _case-knife_.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "I didn't know just what to do--but then I thought.  I scratched around\n",
      "amongst the old tools, and got a pickaxe and give it to him, and he took\n",
      "it and went to work, and never said a word.\n",
      "\n",
      "He was always just that particular.  Full of principle.\n",
      "\n",
      "So then I got a shovel, and then we picked and shoveled, turn about,\n",
      "and made the fur fly.  We stuck to it about a half an hour, which was as\n",
      "long as we could stand up; but we had a good deal of a hole to show for\n",
      "it. When I got up stairs I looked out at the window and see Tom doing\n",
      "his level best with the lightning-rod, but he couldn't come it, his\n",
      "hands was so sore.  At last he says:\n",
      "\n",
      "\"It ain't no use, it can't be done.  What you reckon I better do?  Can't\n",
      "you think of no way?\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Yes,\" I says, \"but I reckon it ain't regular.  Come up the stairs, and\n",
      "let on it's a lightning-rod.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "So he done it.\n",
      "\n",
      "Next day Tom stole a pewter spoon and a brass candlestick in the house,\n",
      "for to make some pens for Jim out of, and six tallow candles; and I\n",
      "hung around the nigger cabins and laid for a chance, and stole three tin\n",
      "plates.  Tom says it wasn't enough; but I said nobody wouldn't ever see\n",
      "the plates that Jim throwed out, because they'd fall in the dog-fennel\n",
      "and jimpson weeds under the window-hole--then we could tote them back and\n",
      "he could use them over again.  So Tom was satisfied.  Then he says:\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Now, the thing to study out is, how to get the things to Jim.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Take them in through the hole,\" I says, \"when we get it done.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "He only just looked scornful, and said something about nobody ever heard\n",
      "of such an idiotic idea, and then he went to studying.  By and by he\n",
      "said he had ciphered out two or three ways, but there warn't no need to\n",
      "decide on any of them yet.  Said we'd got to post Jim first.\n",
      "\n",
      "That night we went down the lightning-rod a little after ten, and took\n",
      "one of the candles along, and listened under the window-hole, and heard\n",
      "Jim snoring; so we pitched it in, and it didn't wake him.  Then we\n",
      "whirled in with the pick and shovel, and in about two hours and a half\n",
      "the job was done.  We crept in under Jim's bed and into the cabin, and\n",
      "pawed around and found the candle and lit it, and stood over Jim awhile,\n",
      "and found him looking hearty and healthy, and then we woke him up gentle\n",
      "and gradual.  He was so glad to see us he most cried; and called us\n",
      "honey, and all the pet names he could think of; and was for having us\n",
      "hunt up a cold-chisel to cut the chain off of his leg with right away,\n",
      "and clearing out without losing any time.  But Tom he showed him how\n",
      "unregular it would be, and set down and told him all about our plans,\n",
      "and how we could alter them in a minute any time there was an alarm; and\n",
      "not to be the least afraid, because we would see he got away, _sure_.\n",
      " So Jim he said it was all right, and we set there and talked over old\n",
      "times awhile, and then Tom asked a lot of questions, and when Jim told\n",
      "him Uncle Silas come in every day or two to pray with him, and Aunt\n",
      "Sally come in to see if he was comfortable and had plenty to eat, and\n",
      "both of them was kind as they could be, Tom says:\n",
      "\n",
      "\"_Now_ I know how to fix it.  We'll send you some things by them.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "I said, \"Don't do nothing of the kind; it's one of the most jackass\n",
      "ideas I ever struck;\" but he never paid no attention to me; went right\n",
      "on.  It was his way when he'd got his plans set.\n",
      "\n",
      "So he told Jim how we'd have to smuggle in the rope-ladder pie and other\n",
      "large things by Nat, the nigger that fed him, and he must be on the\n",
      "lookout, and not be surprised, and not let Nat see him open them; and\n",
      "we would put small things in uncle's coat-pockets and he must steal them\n",
      "out; and we would tie things to aunt's apron-strings or put them in her\n",
      "apron-pocket, if we got a chance; and told him what they would be and\n",
      "what they was for.  And told him how to keep a journal on the shirt with\n",
      "his blood, and all that. He told him everything.  Jim he couldn't see\n",
      "no sense in the most of it, but he allowed we was white folks and knowed\n",
      "better than him; so he was satisfied, and said he would do it all just\n",
      "as Tom said.\n",
      "\n",
      "Jim had plenty corn-cob pipes and tobacco; so we had a right down good\n",
      "sociable time; then we crawled out through the hole, and so home to\n",
      "bed, with hands that looked like they'd been chawed.  Tom was in high\n",
      "spirits. He said it was the best fun he ever had in his life, and the\n",
      "most intellectural; and said if he only could see his way to it we would\n",
      "keep it up all the rest of our lives and leave Jim to our children to\n",
      "get out; for he believed Jim would come to like it better and better the\n",
      "more he got used to it.  He said that in that way it could be strung out\n",
      "to as much as eighty year, and would be the best time on record.  And he\n",
      "said it would make us all celebrated that had a hand in it.\n",
      "\n",
      "In the morning we went out to the woodpile and chopped up the brass\n",
      "candlestick into handy sizes, and Tom put them and the pewter spoon in\n",
      "his pocket.  Then we went to the nigger cabins, and while I got Nat's\n",
      "notice off, Tom shoved a piece of candlestick into the middle of a\n",
      "corn-pone that was in Jim's pan, and we went along with Nat to see how\n",
      "it would work, and it just worked noble; when Jim bit into it it most\n",
      "mashed all his teeth out; and there warn't ever anything could a worked\n",
      "better. Tom said so himself. Jim he never let on but what it was only\n",
      "just a piece of rock or something like that that's always getting into\n",
      "bread, you know; but after that he never bit into nothing but what he\n",
      "jabbed his fork into it in three or four places first.\n",
      "\n",
      "And whilst we was a-standing there in the dimmish light, here comes a\n",
      "couple of the hounds bulging in from under Jim's bed; and they kept on\n",
      "piling in till there was eleven of them, and there warn't hardly room\n",
      "in there to get your breath.  By jings, we forgot to fasten that lean-to\n",
      "door!  The nigger Nat he only just hollered \"Witches\" once, and keeled\n",
      "over on to the floor amongst the dogs, and begun to groan like he was\n",
      "dying.  Tom jerked the door open and flung out a slab of Jim's meat,\n",
      "and the dogs went for it, and in two seconds he was out himself and back\n",
      "again and shut the door, and I knowed he'd fixed the other door too.\n",
      "Then he went to work on the nigger, coaxing him and petting him, and\n",
      "asking him if he'd been imagining he saw something again.  He raised up,\n",
      "and blinked his eyes around, and says:\n",

      "THAT was all fixed.  So then we went away and went to the rubbage-pile\n",
      "in the back yard, where they keep the old boots, and rags, and pieces\n",
      "of bottles, and wore-out tin things, and all such truck, and scratched\n",
      "around and found an old tin washpan, and stopped up the holes as well as\n",

      "with her mouth open and her hands up; and as for me, I wished I was in\n",
      "Jeruslem or somewheres. But not long, because she says:\n",
      "\n",
      "\"It's _just_ as I expected.  So you had it in your pocket all the time;\n",

      "\n",
      "\"I reely don't know, Sally,\" he says, kind of apologizing, \"or you know\n",
      "I would tell.  I was a-studying over my text in Acts Seventeen before\n",
      "breakfast, and I reckon I put it in there, not noticing, meaning to put\n",
      "my Testament in, and it must be so, because my Testament ain't in; but\n",
      "I'll go and see; and if the Testament is where I had it, I'll know I\n",
      "didn't put it in, and that will show that I laid the Testament down and\n",

      "\n",
      "\"Oh, for the land's sake!  Give a body a rest!  Go 'long now, the whole\n",

      "I'D a heard her if she'd a said it to herself, let alone speaking it\n",
      "out; and I'd a got up and obeyed her if I'd a been dead.  As we was\n",
      "passing through the setting-room the old man he took up his hat, and the\n",
      "shingle-nail fell out on the floor, and he just merely picked it up and\n",
      "laid it on the mantel-shelf, and never said nothing, and went out.  Tom\n",
      "see him do it, and remembered about the spoon, and says:\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Well, it ain't no use to send things by _him_ no more, he ain't\n",
      "reliable.\" Then he says:  \"But he done us a good turn with the spoon,\n",
      "anyway, without knowing it, and so we'll go and do him one without _him_\n",
      "knowing it--stop up his rat-holes.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "There was a noble good lot of them down cellar, and it took us a whole\n",
      "hour, but we done the job tight and good and shipshape.  Then we heard\n",
      "steps on the stairs, and blowed out our light and hid; and here comes\n",
      "the old man, with a candle in one hand and a bundle of stuff in t'other,\n",
      "looking as absent-minded as year before last.  He went a mooning around,\n",
      "first to one rat-hole and then another, till he'd been to them all.\n",
      " Then he stood about five minutes, picking tallow-drip off of his candle\n",
      "and thinking.  Then he turns off slow and dreamy towards the stairs,\n",
      "saying:\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Well, for the life of me I can't remember when I done it.  I could\n",

      "mind--let it go.  I reckon it wouldn't do no good.\"\n",
      "\n",

      "mighty nice old man.  And always is.\n",
      "\n",
      "Tom was a good deal bothered about what to do for a spoon, but he said\n",
      "we'd got to have it; so he took a think.  When he had ciphered it out\n",
      "he told me how we was to do; then we went and waited around the\n",
      "spoon-basket till we see Aunt Sally coming, and then Tom went to\n",
      "counting the spoons and laying them out to one side, and I slid one of\n",
      "them up my sleeve, and Tom says:\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Why, Aunt Sally, there ain't but nine spoons _yet_.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "She says:\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Go 'long to your play, and don't bother me.  I know better, I counted\n",
      "'m myself.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Well, I've counted them twice, Aunty, and I can't make but nine.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "She looked out of all patience, but of course she come to count--anybody\n",
      "would.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"I declare to gracious ther' _ain't_ but nine!\" she says.  \"Why, what in\n",
      "the world--plague _take_ the things, I'll count 'm again.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "So I slipped back the one I had, and when she got done counting, she\n",
      "says:\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Hang the troublesome rubbage, ther's _ten_ now!\" and she looked huffy\n",
      "and bothered both.  But Tom says:\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Why, Aunty, I don't think there's ten.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"You numskull, didn't you see me _count 'm?_\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"I know, but--\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Well, I'll count 'm _again_.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "So I smouched one, and they come out nine, same as the other time.\n",
      " Well, she _was_ in a tearing way--just a-trembling all over, she was so\n",
      "mad.  But she counted and counted till she got that addled she'd start\n",
      "to count in the basket for a spoon sometimes; and so, three times they\n",
      "come out right, and three times they come out wrong.  Then she grabbed\n",
      "up the basket and slammed it across the house and knocked the cat\n",
      "galley-west; and she said cle'r out and let her have some peace, and if\n",
      "we come bothering around her again betwixt that and dinner she'd skin\n",
      "us.  So we had the odd spoon, and dropped it in her apron-pocket whilst\n",
      "she was a-giving us our sailing orders, and Jim got it all right, along\n",
      "with her shingle nail, before noon.  We was very well satisfied with\n",
      "this business, and Tom allowed it was worth twice the trouble it took,\n",
      "because he said _now_ she couldn't ever count them spoons twice alike\n",
      "again to save her life; and wouldn't believe she'd counted them right if\n",
      "she _did_; and said that after she'd about counted her head off for the\n",
      "next three days he judged she'd give it up and offer to kill anybody\n",
      "that wanted her to ever count them any more.\n",
      "\n",
      "So we put the sheet back on the line that night, and stole one out of\n",
      "her closet; and kept on putting it back and stealing it again for a\n",
      "couple of days till she didn't know how many sheets she had any more,\n",
      "and she didn't _care_, and warn't a-going to bullyrag the rest of her\n",
      "soul out about it, and wouldn't count them again not to save her life;\n",
      "she druther die first.\n",
      "\n",
      "So we was all right now, as to the shirt and the sheet and the spoon\n",
      "and the candles, by the help of the calf and the rats and the mixed-up\n",
      "counting; and as to the candlestick, it warn't no consequence, it would\n",
      "blow over by and by.\n",
      "\n",
      "But that pie was a job; we had no end of trouble with that pie.  We\n",
      "fixed it up away down in the woods, and cooked it there; and we got it\n",
      "done at last, and very satisfactory, too; but not all in one day; and we\n",
      "had to use up three wash-pans full of flour before we got through, and\n",
      "we got burnt pretty much all over, in places, and eyes put out with\n",
      "the smoke; because, you see, we didn't want nothing but a crust, and we\n",
      "couldn't prop it up right, and she would always cave in.  But of course\n",
      "we thought of the right way at last--which was to cook the ladder, too,\n",
      "in the pie.  So then we laid in with Jim the second night, and tore\n",
      "up the sheet all in little strings and twisted them together, and long\n",
      "before daylight we had a lovely rope that you could a hung a person\n",
      "with.  We let on it took nine months to make it.\n",
      "\n",
      "And in the forenoon we took it down to the woods, but it wouldn't go\n",
      "into the pie.  Being made of a whole sheet, that way, there was rope\n",
      "enough for forty pies if we'd a wanted them, and plenty left over\n",
      "for soup, or sausage, or anything you choose.  We could a had a whole\n",
      "dinner.\n",
      "\n",
      "But we didn't need it.  All we needed was just enough for the pie, and\n",
      "so we throwed the rest away.  We didn't cook none of the pies in the\n",
      "wash-pan--afraid the solder would melt; but Uncle Silas he had a noble\n",

      "England with William the Conqueror in the Mayflower or one of them early\n",
      "ships and was hid away up garret with a lot of other old pots and things\n",
      "that was valuable, not on account of being any account, because they\n",
      "warn't, but on account of them being relicts, you know, and we snaked\n",
      "her out, private, and took her down there, but she failed on the first\n",
      "pies, because we didn't know how, but she come up smiling on the last\n",
      "one.  We took and lined her with dough, and set her in the coals, and\n",
      "loaded her up with rag rope, and put on a dough roof, and shut down the\n",
      "lid, and put hot embers on top, and stood off five foot, with the long\n",
      "handle, cool and comfortable, and in fifteen minutes she turned out a\n",
      "pie that was a satisfaction to look at. But the person that et it would\n",
      "want to fetch a couple of kags of toothpicks along, for if that rope\n",
      "ladder wouldn't cramp him down to business I don't know nothing what I'm\n",

      "tedious hard work and slow, and didn't give my hands no show to get\n",

      "over, and she come mighty near mashing us every time.  Tom said she was\n",
      "going to get one of us, sure, before we got through.  We got her half\n",
      "way; and then we was plumb played out, and most drownded with sweat.  We\n",
      "see it warn't no use; we got to go and fetch Jim. So he raised up his\n",
      "bed and slid the chain off of the bed-leg, and wrapt it round and round\n",

      "with the nail for a chisel and an iron bolt from the rubbage in the\n",
      "lean-to for a hammer, and told him to work till the rest of his candle\n",
      "quit on him, and then he could go to bed, and hide the grindstone under\n",

      "all swarm out for music and go for him.  Jim didn't like the spiders,\n",
      "and the spiders didn't like Jim; and so they'd lay for him, and make it\n",

      "when there was, a body couldn't sleep, it was so lively, and it was\n",

      "to light out of the Tooleries, a servant-girl done it.  It's a very good\n",

      "\n",

      "don't _give_ them notice there won't be nobody nor nothing to interfere\n",

      "\n",
      "But then we heard the tramp of men coming to the door, and heard them\n",

      "\n",
      "\"I _told_ you we'd be too soon; they haven't come--the door is locked.\n",

      "\n",
      "So in they come, but couldn't see us in the dark, and most trod on\n",
      "us whilst we was hustling to get under the bed.  But we got under all\n",
      "right, and out through the hole, swift but soft--Jim first, me next,\n",
      "and Tom last, which was according to Tom's orders.  Now we was in the\n",
      "lean-to, and heard trampings close by outside.  So we crept to the door,\n",
      "and Tom stopped us there and put his eye to the crack, but couldn't make\n",
      "out nothing, it was so dark; and whispered and said he would listen\n",
      "for the steps to get further, and when he nudged us Jim must glide out\n",
      "first, and him last.  So he set his ear to the crack and listened, and\n",
      "listened, and listened, and the steps a-scraping around out there all\n",
      "the time; and at last he nudged us, and we slid out, and stooped down,\n",
      "not breathing, and not making the least noise, and slipped stealthy\n",
      "towards the fence in Injun file, and got to it all right, and me and Jim\n",
      "over it; but Tom's britches catched fast on a splinter on the top\n",
      "rail, and then he hear the steps coming, so he had to pull loose, which\n",
      "snapped the splinter and made a noise; and as he dropped in our tracks\n",
      "and started somebody sings out:\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Who's that?  Answer, or I'll shoot!\"\n",
      "\n",
      "But we didn't answer; we just unfurled our heels and shoved.  Then there\n",
      "was a rush, and a _Bang, Bang, Bang!_ and the bullets fairly whizzed\n",
      "around us! We heard them sing out:\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Here they are!  They've broke for the river!  After 'em, boys, and turn\n",
      "loose the dogs!\"\n",
      "\n",
      "So here they come, full tilt.  We could hear them because they wore\n",
      "boots and yelled, but we didn't wear no boots and didn't yell.  We was\n",
      "in the path to the mill; and when they got pretty close on to us we\n",
      "dodged into the bush and let them go by, and then dropped in behind\n",
      "them.  They'd had all the dogs shut up, so they wouldn't scare off the\n",
      "robbers; but by this time somebody had let them loose, and here they\n",
      "come, making powwow enough for a million; but they was our dogs; so we\n",
      "stopped in our tracks till they catched up; and when they see it warn't\n",
      "nobody but us, and no excitement to offer them, they only just said\n",
      "howdy, and tore right ahead towards the shouting and clattering; and\n",
      "then we up-steam again, and whizzed along after them till we was nearly\n",
      "to the mill, and then struck up through the bush to where my canoe was\n",
      "tied, and hopped in and pulled for dear life towards the middle of the\n",
      "river, but didn't make no more noise than we was obleeged to. Then we\n",
      "struck out, easy and comfortable, for the island where my raft was; and\n",
      "we could hear them yelling and barking at each other all up and down the\n",
      "bank, till we was so far away the sounds got dim and died out.  And when\n",
      "we stepped on to the raft I says:\n",
      "\n",
      "\"_Now_, old Jim, you're a free man again, and I bet you won't ever be a\n",
      "slave no more.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"En a mighty good job it wuz, too, Huck.  It 'uz planned beautiful, en\n",

      "\n",
      "We was all glad as we could be, but Tom was the gladdest of all because\n",
      "he had a bullet in the calf of his leg.\n",
      "\n",
      "When me and Jim heard that we didn't feel so brash as what we did\n",
      "before. It was hurting him considerable, and bleeding; so we laid him in\n",
      "the wigwam and tore up one of the duke's shirts for to bandage him, but\n",
      "he says:\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Gimme the rags; I can do it myself.  Don't stop now; don't fool around\n",
      "here, and the evasion booming along so handsome; man the sweeps, and set\n",

      "sweeps!\"\n",
      "\n",
      "But me and Jim was consulting--and thinking.  And after we'd thought a\n",
      "minute, I says:\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Say it, Jim.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "So he says:\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Well, den, dis is de way it look to me, Huck.  Ef it wuz _him_ dat 'uz\n",
      "bein' sot free, en one er de boys wuz to git shot, would he say, 'Go on\n",

      "Mars Tom Sawyer?  Would he say dat?  You _bet_ he wouldn't!  _well_,\n",
      "den, is _Jim_ gywne to say it?  No, sah--I doan' budge a step out'n dis\n",
      "place 'dout a _doctor_, not if it's forty year!\"\n",
      "\n",
      "I knowed he was white inside, and I reckoned he'd say what he did say--so\n",
      "it was all right now, and I told Tom I was a-going for a doctor.\n",
      " He raised considerable row about it, but me and Jim stuck to it and\n",
      "wouldn't budge; so he was for crawling out and setting the raft loose\n",
      "himself; but we wouldn't let him.  Then he give us a piece of his mind,\n",
      "but it didn't do no good.\n",
      "\n",
      "So when he sees me getting the canoe ready, he says:\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Well, then, if you're bound to go, I'll tell you the way to do when you\n",
      "get to the village.  Shut the door and blindfold the doctor tight and\n",
      "fast, and make him swear to be silent as the grave, and put a purse\n",
      "full of gold in his hand, and then take and lead him all around the\n",
      "back alleys and everywheres in the dark, and then fetch him here in the\n",
      "canoe, in a roundabout way amongst the islands, and search him and take\n",
      "his chalk away from him, and don't give it back to him till you get him\n",
      "back to the village, or else he will chalk this raft so he can find it\n",
      "again. It's the way they all do.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "So I said I would, and left, and Jim was to hide in the woods when he\n",
      "see the doctor coming till he was gone again.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "CHAPTER XLI.\n",
      "\n",
      "THE doctor was an old man; a very nice, kind-looking old man when I got\n",
      "him up.  I told him me and my brother was over on Spanish Island hunting\n",
      "yesterday afternoon, and camped on a piece of a raft we found, and about\n",
      "midnight he must a kicked his gun in his dreams, for it went off and\n",
      "shot him in the leg, and we wanted him to go over there and fix it and\n",
      "not say nothing about it, nor let anybody know, because we wanted to\n",
      "come home this evening and surprise the folks.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Who is your folks?\" he says.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"The Phelpses, down yonder.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Oh,\" he says.  And after a minute, he says:\n",
      "\n",
      "\"How'd you say he got shot?\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"He had a dream,\" I says, \"and it shot him.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Singular dream,\" he says.\n",
      "\n",
      "So he lit up his lantern, and got his saddle-bags, and we started.  But\n",
      "when he sees the canoe he didn't like the look of her--said she was big\n",
      "enough for one, but didn't look pretty safe for two.  I says:\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Oh, you needn't be afeard, sir, she carried the three of us easy\n",
      "enough.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"What three?\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Why, me and Sid, and--and--and _the guns_; that's what I mean.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Oh,\" he says.\n",
      "\n",
      "But he put his foot on the gunnel and rocked her, and shook his head,\n",
      "and said he reckoned he'd look around for a bigger one.  But they was\n",
      "all locked and chained; so he took my canoe, and said for me to wait\n",
      "till he come back, or I could hunt around further, or maybe I better\n",
      "go down home and get them ready for the surprise if I wanted to.  But\n",
      "I said I didn't; so I told him just how to find the raft, and then he\n",
      "started.\n",
      "\n",
      "I struck an idea pretty soon.  I says to myself, spos'n he can't fix\n",
      "that leg just in three shakes of a sheep's tail, as the saying is?\n",
      "spos'n it takes him three or four days?  What are we going to do?--lay\n",
      "around there till he lets the cat out of the bag?  No, sir; I know what\n",
      "_I'll_ do.  I'll wait, and when he comes back if he says he's got to\n",
      "go any more I'll get down there, too, if I swim; and we'll take and tie\n",
      "him, and keep him, and shove out down the river; and when Tom's done\n",
      "with him we'll give him what it's worth, or all we got, and then let him\n",
      "get ashore.\n",
      "\n",
      "So then I crept into a lumber-pile to get some sleep; and next time I\n",
      "waked up the sun was away up over my head!  I shot out and went for the\n",
      "doctor's house, but they told me he'd gone away in the night some time\n",
      "or other, and warn't back yet.  Well, thinks I, that looks powerful bad\n",
      "for Tom, and I'll dig out for the island right off.  So away I shoved,\n",
      "and turned the corner, and nearly rammed my head into Uncle Silas's\n",
      "stomach! He says:\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Why, _Tom!_  Where you been all this time, you rascal?\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"I hain't been nowheres,\" I says, \"only just hunting for the runaway\n",

      "\n",
      "\"She needn't,\" I says, \"because we was all right.  We followed the men\n",
      "and the dogs, but they outrun us, and we lost them; but we thought we\n",
      "heard them on the water, so we got a canoe and took out after them and\n",
      "crossed over, but couldn't find nothing of them; so we cruised along\n",
      "up-shore till we got kind of tired and beat out; and tied up the canoe\n",
      "and went to sleep, and never waked up till about an hour ago; then we\n",
      "paddled over here to hear the news, and Sid's at the post-office to see\n",
      "what he can hear, and I'm a-branching out to get something to eat for\n",
      "us, and then we're going home.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "So then we went to the post-office to get \"Sid\"; but just as I\n",
      "suspicioned, he warn't there; so the old man he got a letter out of the\n",
      "office, and we waited awhile longer, but Sid didn't come; so the old man\n",
      "said, come along, let Sid foot it home, or canoe it, when he got done\n",
      "fooling around--but we would ride.  I couldn't get him to let me stay\n",

      "But what most puzzled and confounded you was a long, limber, portentous,\n",
      "black mass of something hovering in the centre of the picture over three\n",
      "blue, dim, perpendicular lines floating in a nameless yeast. A boggy,\n",
      "soggy, squitchy picture truly, enough to drive a nervous man distracted.\n",
      "Yet was there a sort of indefinite, half-attained, unimaginable\n",
      "sublimity about it that fairly froze you to it, till you involuntarily\n",
      "took an oath with yourself to find out what that marvellous painting\n",
      "meant. Ever and anon a bright, but, alas, deceptive idea would dart you\n",
      "through.--It's the Black Sea in a midnight gale.--It's the unnatural\n",

      "fish? even the great leviathan himself?\n",
      "\n",
      "In fact, the artist's design seemed this: a final theory of my own,\n",
      "partly based upon the aggregated opinions of many aged persons with whom\n",
      "I conversed upon the subject. The picture represents a Cape-Horner in a\n",
      "great hurricane; the half-foundered ship weltering there with its three\n",
      "dismantled masts alone visible; and an exasperated whale, purposing to\n",

      "The opposite wall of this entry was hung all over with a heathenish\n",
      "array of monstrous clubs and spears. Some were thickly set with\n",
      "glittering teeth resembling ivory saws; others were tufted with knots of\n",
      "human hair; and one was sickle-shaped, with a vast handle sweeping round\n",
      "like the segment made in the new-mown grass by a long-armed mower. You\n",
      "shuddered as you gazed, and wondered what monstrous cannibal and savage\n",
      "could ever have gone a death-harvesting with such a hacking, horrifying\n",
      "implement. Mixed with these were rusty old whaling lances and harpoons\n",
      "all broken and deformed. Some were storied weapons. With this once long\n",
      "lance, now wildly elbowed, fifty years ago did Nathan Swain kill fifteen\n",
      "whales between a sunrise and a sunset. And that harpoon--so like a\n",
      "corkscrew now--was flung in Javan seas, and run away with by a whale,\n",
      "years afterwards slain off the Cape of Blanco. The original iron entered\n",
      "nigh the tail, and, like a restless needle sojourning in the body of a\n",

      "\n",

      "his jack-knife, stooping over and diligently working away at the space\n",

      "At last some four or five of us were summoned to our meal in an\n",

      "said he couldn't afford it. Nothing but two dismal tallow candles, each\n",
      "in a winding sheet. We were fain to button up our monkey jackets, and\n",
      "hold to our lips cups of scalding tea with our half frozen fingers. But\n",
      "the fare was of the most substantial kind--not only meat and potatoes,\n",

      "\n",
      "A tramping of sea boots was heard in the entry; the door was flung open,\n",
      "and in rolled a wild set of mariners enough. Enveloped in their shaggy\n",
      "watch coats, and with their heads muffled in woollen comforters, all\n",
      "bedarned and ragged, and their beards stiff with icicles, they seemed an\n",
      "eruption of bears from Labrador. They had just landed from their boat,\n",
      "and this was the first house they entered. No wonder, then, that they\n",
      "made a straight wake for the whale's mouth--the bar--when the wrinkled\n",
      "little old Jonah, there officiating, soon poured them out brimmers all\n",
      "round. One complained of a bad cold in his head, upon which Jonah\n",
      "mixed him a pitch-like potion of gin and molasses, which he swore was a\n",
      "sovereign cure for all colds and catarrhs whatsoever, never mind of how\n",
      "long standing, or whether caught off the coast of Labrador, or on the\n",
      "weather side of an ice-island.\n",
      "\n",
      "The liquor soon mounted into their heads, as it generally does even\n",
      "with the arrantest topers newly landed from sea, and they began capering\n",
      "about most obstreperously.\n",
      "\n",
      "I observed, however, that one of them held somewhat aloof, and though\n",
      "he seemed desirous not to spoil the hilarity of his shipmates by his own\n",
      "sober face, yet upon the whole he refrained from making as much noise\n",
      "as the rest. This man interested me at once; and since the sea-gods\n",
      "had ordained that he should soon become my shipmate (though but a\n",
      "sleeping-partner one, so far as this narrative is concerned), I will\n",
      "here venture upon a little description of him. He stood full six feet\n",
      "in height, with noble shoulders, and a chest like a coffer-dam. I have\n",
      "seldom seen such brawn in a man. His face was deeply brown and burnt,\n",
      "making his white teeth dazzling by the contrast; while in the deep\n",
      "shadows of his eyes floated some reminiscences that did not seem to give\n",
      "him much joy. His voice at once announced that he was a Southerner,\n",
      "and from his fine stature, I thought he must be one of those tall\n",
      "mountaineers from the Alleghanian Ridge in Virginia. When the revelry\n",
      "of his companions had mounted to its height, this man slipped away\n",
      "unobserved, and I saw no more of him till he became my comrade on the\n",
      "sea. In a few minutes, however, he was missed by his shipmates, and\n",
      "being, it seems, for some reason a huge favourite with them, they raised\n",
      "a cry of \"Bulkington! Bulkington! where's Bulkington?\" and darted out of\n",
      "the house in pursuit of him.\n",
      "\n",
      "It was now about nine o'clock, and the room seeming almost\n",
      "supernaturally quiet after these orgies, I began to congratulate myself\n",
      "upon a little plan that had occurred to me just previous to the entrance\n",
      "of the seamen.\n",
      "\n",
      "No man prefers to sleep two in a bed. In fact, you would a good deal\n",
      "rather not sleep with your own brother. I don't know how it is, but\n",
      "people like to be private when they are sleeping. And when it comes to\n",
      "sleeping with an unknown stranger, in a strange inn, in a strange\n",
      "town, and that stranger a harpooneer, then your objections indefinitely\n",
      "multiply. Nor was there any earthly reason why I as a sailor should\n",
      "sleep two in a bed, more than anybody else; for sailors no more sleep\n",
      "two in a bed at sea, than bachelor Kings do ashore. To be sure they\n",
      "all sleep together in one apartment, but you have your own hammock, and\n",
      "cover yourself with your own blanket, and sleep in your own skin.\n",
      "\n",
      "The more I pondered over this harpooneer, the more I abominated the\n",
      "thought of sleeping with him. It was fair to presume that being a\n",
      "harpooneer, his linen or woollen, as the case might be, would not be of\n",
      "the tidiest, certainly none of the finest. I began to twitch all over.\n",
      "Besides, it was getting late, and my decent harpooneer ought to be\n",
      "home and going bedwards. Suppose now, he should tumble in upon me at\n",
      "midnight--how could I tell from what vile hole he had been coming?\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Landlord! I've changed my mind about that harpooneer.--I shan't sleep\n",
      "with him. I'll try the bench here.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Just as you please; I'm sorry I cant spare ye a tablecloth for a\n",
      "mattress, and it's a plaguy rough board here\"--feeling of the knots and\n",
      "notches. \"But wait a bit, Skrimshander; I've got a carpenter's plane\n",
      "there in the bar--wait, I say, and I'll make ye snug enough.\" So saying\n",
      "he procured the plane; and with his old silk handkerchief first dusting\n",
      "the bench, vigorously set to planing away at my bed, the while grinning\n",
      "like an ape. The shavings flew right and left; till at last the\n",
      "plane-iron came bump against an indestructible knot. The landlord was\n",
      "near spraining his wrist, and I told him for heaven's sake to quit--the\n",
      "bed was soft enough to suit me, and I did not know how all the planing\n",
      "in the world could make eider down of a pine plank. So gathering up the\n",
      "shavings with another grin, and throwing them into the great stove in\n",
      "the middle of the room, he went about his business, and left me in a\n",
      "brown study.\n",
      "\n",
      "I now took the measure of the bench, and found that it was a foot too\n",
      "short; but that could be mended with a chair. But it was a foot too\n",
      "narrow, and the other bench in the room was about four inches higher\n",
      "than the planed one--so there was no yoking them. I then placed the\n",
      "first bench lengthwise along the only clear space against the wall,\n",
      "leaving a little interval between, for my back to settle down in. But I\n",
      "soon found that there came such a draught of cold air over me from under\n",
      "the sill of the window, that this plan would never do at all, especially\n",
      "as another current from the rickety door met the one from the window,\n",
      "and both together formed a series of small whirlwinds in the immediate\n",
      "vicinity of the spot where I had thought to spend the night.\n",
      "\n",
      "The devil fetch that harpooneer, thought I, but stop, couldn't I steal\n",
      "a march on him--bolt his door inside, and jump into his bed, not to be\n",
      "wakened by the most violent knockings? It seemed no bad idea; but upon\n",
      "second thoughts I dismissed it. For who could tell but what the next\n",
      "morning, so soon as I popped out of the room, the harpooneer might be\n",
      "standing in the entry, all ready to knock me down!\n",
      "\n",
      "Still, looking round me again, and seeing no possible chance of spending\n",
      "a sufferable night unless in some other person's bed, I began to think\n",
      "that after all I might be cherishing unwarrantable prejudices against\n",
      "this unknown harpooneer. Thinks I, I'll wait awhile; he must be dropping\n",
      "in before long. I'll have a good look at him then, and perhaps we may\n",
      "become jolly good bedfellows after all--there's no telling.\n",
      "\n",
      "But though the other boarders kept coming in by ones, twos, and threes,\n",
      "and going to bed, yet no sign of my harpooneer.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Landlord!\" said I, \"what sort of a chap is he--does he always keep such\n",
      "late hours?\" It was now hard upon twelve o'clock.\n",
      "\n",
      "The landlord chuckled again with his lean chuckle, and seemed to\n",
      "be mightily tickled at something beyond my comprehension. \"No,\" he\n",
      "answered, \"generally he's an early bird--airley to bed and airley to\n",
      "rise--yes, he's the bird what catches the worm. But to-night he went out\n",
      "a peddling, you see, and I don't see what on airth keeps him so late,\n",
      "unless, may be, he can't sell his head.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Can't sell his head?--What sort of a bamboozingly story is this you\n",
      "are telling me?\" getting into a towering rage. \"Do you pretend to say,\n",
      "landlord, that this harpooneer is actually engaged this blessed Saturday\n",
      "night, or rather Sunday morning, in peddling his head around this town?\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"That's precisely it,\" said the landlord, \"and I told him he couldn't\n",
      "sell it here, the market's overstocked.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"With what?\" shouted I.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"With heads to be sure; ain't there too many heads in the world?\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"I tell you what it is, landlord,\" said I quite calmly, \"you'd better\n",
      "stop spinning that yarn to me--I'm not green.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"May be not,\" taking out a stick and whittling a toothpick, \"but I\n",
      "rayther guess you'll be done BROWN if that ere harpooneer hears you a\n",
      "slanderin' his head.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"I'll break it for him,\" said I, now flying into a passion again at this\n",
      "unaccountable farrago of the landlord's.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"It's broke a'ready,\" said he.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Broke,\" said I--\"BROKE, do you mean?\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Sartain, and that's the very reason he can't sell it, I guess.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Landlord,\" said I, going up to him as cool as Mt. Hecla in a\n",
      "snow-storm--\"landlord, stop whittling. You and I must understand one\n",
      "another, and that too without delay. I come to your house and want a\n",
      "bed; you tell me you can only give me half a one; that the other half\n",
      "belongs to a certain harpooneer. And about this harpooneer, whom I\n",
      "have not yet seen, you persist in telling me the most mystifying and\n",
      "exasperating stories tending to beget in me an uncomfortable feeling\n",
      "towards the man whom you design for my bedfellow--a sort of connexion,\n",
      "landlord, which is an intimate and confidential one in the highest\n",
      "degree. I now demand of you to speak out and tell me who and what this\n",
      "harpooneer is, and whether I shall be in all respects safe to spend the\n",
      "night with him. And in the first place, you will be so good as to unsay\n",
      "that story about selling his head, which if true I take to be good\n",
      "evidence that this harpooneer is stark mad, and I've no idea of sleeping\n",
      "with a madman; and you, sir, YOU I mean, landlord, YOU, sir, by trying\n",
      "to induce me to do so knowingly, would thereby render yourself liable to\n",
      "a criminal prosecution.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Wall,\" said the landlord, fetching a long breath, \"that's a purty long\n",
      "sarmon for a chap that rips a little now and then. But be easy, be easy,\n",
      "this here harpooneer I have been tellin' you of has just arrived from\n",
      "the south seas, where he bought up a lot of 'balmed New Zealand heads\n",
      "(great curios, you know), and he's sold all on 'em but one, and that one\n",
      "he's trying to sell to-night, cause to-morrow's Sunday, and it would not\n",
      "do to be sellin' human heads about the streets when folks is goin' to\n",
      "churches. He wanted to, last Sunday, but I stopped him just as he was\n",
      "goin' out of the door with four heads strung on a string, for all the\n",
      "airth like a string of inions.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "This account cleared up the otherwise unaccountable mystery, and showed\n",
      "that the landlord, after all, had had no idea of fooling me--but at\n",
      "the same time what could I think of a harpooneer who stayed out of a\n",
      "Saturday night clean into the holy Sabbath, engaged in such a cannibal\n",
      "business as selling the heads of dead idolators?\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Depend upon it, landlord, that harpooneer is a dangerous man.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"He pays reg'lar,\" was the rejoinder. \"But come, it's getting dreadful\n",
      "late, you had better be turning flukes--it's a nice bed; Sal and me\n",
      "slept in that ere bed the night we were spliced. There's plenty of room\n",
      "for two to kick about in that bed; it's an almighty big bed that. Why,\n",
      "afore we give it up, Sal used to put our Sam and little Johnny in the\n",
      "foot of it. But I got a dreaming and sprawling about one night, and\n",
      "somehow, Sam got pitched on the floor, and came near breaking his arm.\n",
      "Arter that, Sal said it wouldn't do. Come along here, I'll give ye a\n",
      "glim in a jiffy;\" and so saying he lighted a candle and held it towards\n",
      "me, offering to lead the way. But I stood irresolute; when looking at a\n",
      "clock in the corner, he exclaimed \"I vum it's Sunday--you won't see that\n",
      "harpooneer to-night; he's come to anchor somewhere--come along then; DO\n",
      "come; WON'T ye come?\"\n",
      "\n",
      "I considered the matter a moment, and then up stairs we went, and I was\n",
      "ushered into a small room, cold as a clam, and furnished, sure enough,\n",
      "with a prodigious bed, almost big enough indeed for any four harpooneers\n",
      "to sleep abreast.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"There,\" said the landlord, placing the candle on a crazy old sea chest\n",
      "that did double duty as a wash-stand and centre table; \"there, make\n",
      "yourself comfortable now, and good night to ye.\" I turned round from\n",
      "eyeing the bed, but he had disappeared.\n",
      "\n",
      "Folding back the counterpane, I stooped over the bed. Though none of the\n",
      "most elegant, it yet stood the scrutiny tolerably well. I then glanced\n",
      "round the room; and besides the bedstead and centre table, could see\n",
      "no other furniture belonging to the place, but a rude shelf, the four\n",
      "walls, and a papered fireboard representing a man striking a whale. Of\n",
      "things not properly belonging to the room, there was a hammock lashed\n",
      "up, and thrown upon the floor in one corner; also a large seaman's bag,\n",
      "containing the harpooneer's wardrobe, no doubt in lieu of a land trunk.\n",
      "Likewise, there was a parcel of outlandish bone fish hooks on the shelf\n",
      "over the fire-place, and a tall harpoon standing at the head of the bed.\n",
      "\n",
      "But what is this on the chest? I took it up, and held it close to the\n",
      "light, and felt it, and smelt it, and tried every way possible to arrive\n",
      "at some satisfactory conclusion concerning it. I can compare it to\n",
      "nothing but a large door mat, ornamented at the edges with little\n",
      "tinkling tags something like the stained porcupine quills round an\n",
      "Indian moccasin. There was a hole or slit in the middle of this mat,\n",
      "as you see the same in South American ponchos. But could it be possible\n",
      "that any sober harpooneer would get into a door mat, and parade the\n",
      "streets of any Christian town in that sort of guise? I put it on, to try\n",
      "it, and it weighed me down like a hamper, being uncommonly shaggy and\n",
      "thick, and I thought a little damp, as though this mysterious harpooneer\n",
      "had been wearing it of a rainy day. I went up in it to a bit of glass\n",
      "stuck against the wall, and I never saw such a sight in my life. I tore\n",
      "myself out of it in such a hurry that I gave myself a kink in the neck.\n",
      "\n",
      "I sat down on the side of the bed, and commenced thinking about this\n",
      "head-peddling harpooneer, and his door mat. After thinking some time on\n",
      "the bed-side, I got up and took off my monkey jacket, and then stood in\n",
      "the middle of the room thinking. I then took off my coat, and thought\n",
      "a little more in my shirt sleeves. But beginning to feel very cold now,\n",
      "half undressed as I was, and remembering what the landlord said about\n",
      "the harpooneer's not coming home at all that night, it being so very\n",
      "late, I made no more ado, but jumped out of my pantaloons and boots, and\n",
      "then blowing out the light tumbled into bed, and commended myself to the\n",
      "care of heaven.\n",
      "\n",
      "Whether that mattress was stuffed with corn-cobs or broken crockery,\n",
      "there is no telling, but I rolled about a good deal, and could not sleep\n",
      "for a long time. At last I slid off into a light doze, and had pretty\n",
      "nearly made a good offing towards the land of Nod, when I heard a heavy\n",
      "footfall in the passage, and saw a glimmer of light come into the room\n",
      "from under the door.\n",
      "\n",
      "Lord save me, thinks I, that must be the harpooneer, the infernal\n",
      "head-peddler. But I lay perfectly still, and resolved not to say a word\n",
      "till spoken to. Holding a light in one hand, and that identical New\n",
      "Zealand head in the other, the stranger entered the room, and without\n",
      "looking towards the bed, placed his candle a good way off from me on the\n",
      "floor in one corner, and then began working away at the knotted cords\n",
      "of the large bag I before spoke of as being in the room. I was all\n",
      "eagerness to see his face, but he kept it averted for some time while\n",
      "employed in unlacing the bag's mouth. This accomplished, however, he\n",
      "turned round--when, good heavens! what a sight! Such a face! It was of\n",
      "a dark, purplish, yellow colour, here and there stuck over with large\n",
      "blackish looking squares. Yes, it's just as I thought, he's a terrible\n",
      "bedfellow; he's been in a fight, got dreadfully cut, and here he is,\n",
      "just from the surgeon. But at that moment he chanced to turn his face\n",
      "so towards the light, that I plainly saw they could not be\n",
      "sticking-plasters at all, those black squares on his cheeks. They were\n",
      "stains of some sort or other. At first I knew not what to make of this;\n",
      "but soon an inkling of the truth occurred to me. I remembered a story of\n",
      "a white man--a whaleman too--who, falling among the cannibals, had been\n",
      "tattooed by them. I concluded that this harpooneer, in the course of his\n",
      "distant voyages, must have met with a similar adventure. And what is it,\n",
      "thought I, after all! It's only his outside; a man can be honest in any\n",
      "sort of skin. But then, what to make of his unearthly complexion, that\n",
      "part of it, I mean, lying round about, and completely independent of the\n",
      "squares of tattooing. To be sure, it might be nothing but a good coat of\n",
      "tropical tanning; but I never heard of a hot sun's tanning a white man\n",
      "into a purplish yellow one. However, I had never been in the South Seas;\n",
      "and perhaps the sun there produced these extraordinary effects upon the\n",
      "skin. Now, while all these ideas were passing through me like lightning,\n",
      "this harpooneer never noticed me at all. But, after some difficulty\n",
      "having opened his bag, he commenced fumbling in it, and presently pulled\n",
      "out a sort of tomahawk, and a seal-skin wallet with the hair on. Placing\n",
      "these on the old chest in the middle of the room, he then took the New\n",
      "Zealand head--a ghastly thing enough--and crammed it down into the bag.\n",
      "He now took off his hat--a new beaver hat--when I came nigh singing out\n",
      "with fresh surprise. There was no hair on his head--none to speak of at\n",
      "least--nothing but a small scalp-knot twisted up on his forehead. His\n",
      "bald purplish head now looked for all the world like a mildewed skull.\n",
      "Had not the stranger stood between me and the door, I would have bolted\n",
      "out of it quicker than ever I bolted a dinner.\n",
      "\n",
      "Even as it was, I thought something of slipping out of the window, but\n",
      "it was the second floor back. I am no coward, but what to make of\n",
      "this head-peddling purple rascal altogether passed my comprehension.\n",
      "Ignorance is the parent of fear, and being completely nonplussed and\n",
      "confounded about the stranger, I confess I was now as much afraid of him\n",
      "as if it was the devil himself who had thus broken into my room at\n",
      "the dead of night. In fact, I was so afraid of him that I was not\n",
      "game enough just then to address him, and demand a satisfactory answer\n",
      "concerning what seemed inexplicable in him.\n",
      "\n",
      "Meanwhile, he continued the business of undressing, and at last showed\n",
      "his chest and arms. As I live, these covered parts of him were checkered\n",
      "with the same squares as his face; his back, too, was all over the same\n",
      "dark squares; he seemed to have been in a Thirty Years' War, and just\n",
      "escaped from it with a sticking-plaster shirt. Still more, his very\n",
      "legs were marked, as if a parcel of dark green frogs were running up\n",
      "the trunks of young palms. It was now quite plain that he must be some\n",
      "abominable savage or other shipped aboard of a whaleman in the South\n",
      "Seas, and so landed in this Christian country. I quaked to think of it.\n",
      "A peddler of heads too--perhaps the heads of his own brothers. He might\n",
      "take a fancy to mine--heavens! look at that tomahawk!\n",
      "\n",
      "But there was no time for shuddering, for now the savage went about\n",
      "something that completely fascinated my attention, and convinced me that\n",
      "he must indeed be a heathen. Going to his heavy grego, or wrapall, or\n",
      "dreadnaught, which he had previously hung on a chair, he fumbled in the\n",
      "pockets, and produced at length a curious little deformed image with\n",
      "a hunch on its back, and exactly the colour of a three days' old Congo\n",
      "baby. Remembering the embalmed head, at first I almost thought that\n",
      "this black manikin was a real baby preserved in some similar manner. But\n",
      "seeing that it was not at all limber, and that it glistened a good deal\n",
      "like polished ebony, I concluded that it must be nothing but a wooden\n",
      "idol, which indeed it proved to be. For now the savage goes up to the\n",
      "empty fire-place, and removing the papered fire-board, sets up this\n",
      "little hunch-backed image, like a tenpin, between the andirons. The\n",
      "chimney jambs and all the bricks inside were very sooty, so that I\n",
      "thought this fire-place made a very appropriate little shrine or chapel\n",
      "for his Congo idol.\n",
      "\n",
      "I now screwed my eyes hard towards the half hidden image, feeling but\n",
      "ill at ease meantime--to see what was next to follow. First he takes\n",
      "about a double handful of shavings out of his grego pocket, and places\n",
      "them carefully before the idol; then laying a bit of ship biscuit on\n",
      "top and applying the flame from the lamp, he kindled the shavings into\n",
      "a sacrificial blaze. Presently, after many hasty snatches into the fire,\n",
      "and still hastier withdrawals of his fingers (whereby he seemed to be\n",
      "scorching them badly), he at last succeeded in drawing out the biscuit;\n",
      "then blowing off the heat and ashes a little, he made a polite offer of\n",
      "it to the little negro. But the little devil did not seem to fancy such\n",
      "dry sort of fare at all; he never moved his lips. All these strange\n",
      "antics were accompanied by still stranger guttural noises from the\n",
      "devotee, who seemed to be praying in a sing-song or else singing some\n",
      "pagan psalmody or other, during which his face twitched about in the\n",
      "most unnatural manner. At last extinguishing the fire, he took the idol\n",
      "up very unceremoniously, and bagged it again in his grego pocket as\n",
      "carelessly as if he were a sportsman bagging a dead woodcock.\n",
      "\n",
      "All these queer proceedings increased my uncomfortableness, and\n",
      "seeing him now exhibiting strong symptoms of concluding his business\n",
      "operations, and jumping into bed with me, I thought it was high time,\n",
      "now or never, before the light was put out, to break the spell in which\n",
      "I had so long been bound.\n",
      "\n",
      "But the interval I spent in deliberating what to say, was a fatal one.\n",
      "Taking up his tomahawk from the table, he examined the head of it for an\n",
      "instant, and then holding it to the light, with his mouth at the handle,\n",
      "he puffed out great clouds of tobacco smoke. The next moment the light\n",
      "was extinguished, and this wild cannibal, tomahawk between his teeth,\n",
      "sprang into bed with me. I sang out, I could not help it now; and giving\n",
      "a sudden grunt of astonishment he began feeling me.\n",
      "\n",
      "Stammering out something, I knew not what, I rolled away from him\n",
      "against the wall, and then conjured him, whoever or whatever he might\n",
      "be, to keep quiet, and let me get up and light the lamp again. But his\n",
      "guttural responses satisfied me at once that he but ill comprehended my\n",
      "meaning.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Who-e debel you?\"--he at last said--\"you no speak-e, dam-me, I kill-e.\"\n",
      "And so saying the lighted tomahawk began flourishing about me in the\n",
      "dark.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Landlord, for God's sake, Peter Coffin!\" shouted I. \"Landlord! Watch!\n",
      "Coffin! Angels! save me!\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Speak-e! tell-ee me who-ee be, or dam-me, I kill-e!\" again growled the\n",
      "cannibal, while his horrid flourishings of the tomahawk scattered the\n",
      "hot tobacco ashes about me till I thought my linen would get on fire.\n",
      "But thank heaven, at that moment the landlord came into the room light\n",
      "in hand, and leaping from the bed I ran up to him.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Don't be afraid now,\" said he, grinning again, \"Queequeg here wouldn't\n",
      "harm a hair of your head.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Stop your grinning,\" shouted I, \"and why didn't you tell me that that\n",
      "infernal harpooneer was a cannibal?\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"I thought ye know'd it;--didn't I tell ye, he was a peddlin' heads\n",
      "around town?--but turn flukes again and go to sleep. Queequeg, look\n",
      "here--you sabbee me, I sabbee--you this man sleepe you--you sabbee?\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Me sabbee plenty\"--grunted Queequeg, puffing away at his pipe and\n",
      "sitting up in bed.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"You gettee in,\" he added, motioning to me with his tomahawk, and\n",
      "throwing the clothes to one side. He really did this in not only a civil\n",
      "but a really kind and charitable way. I stood looking at him a moment.\n",
      "For all his tattooings he was on the whole a clean, comely looking\n",
      "cannibal. What's all this fuss I have been making about, thought I to\n",
      "myself--the man's a human being just as I am: he has just as much reason\n",
      "to fear me, as I have to be afraid of him. Better sleep with a sober\n",
      "cannibal than a drunken Christian.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Landlord,\" said I, \"tell him to stash his tomahawk there, or pipe, or\n",
      "whatever you call it; tell him to stop smoking, in short, and I will\n",
      "turn in with him. But I don't fancy having a man smoking in bed with me.\n",
      "It's dangerous. Besides, I ain't insured.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "This being told to Queequeg, he at once complied, and again politely\n",
      "motioned me to get into bed--rolling over to one side as much as to\n",
      "say--\"I won't touch a leg of ye.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Good night, landlord,\" said I, \"you may go.\"\n",

      "CHAPTER 4. The Counterpane.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "Upon waking next morning about daylight, I found Queequeg's arm thrown\n",
      "over me in the most loving and affectionate manner. You had almost\n",
      "thought I had been his wife. The counterpane was of patchwork, full of\n",
      "odd little parti-coloured squares and triangles; and this arm of his\n",
      "tattooed all over with an interminable Cretan labyrinth of a figure,\n",
      "no two parts of which were of one precise shade--owing I suppose to\n",
      "his keeping his arm at sea unmethodically in sun and shade, his shirt\n",
      "sleeves irregularly rolled up at various times--this same arm of his, I\n",
      "say, looked for all the world like a strip of that same patchwork quilt.\n",
      "Indeed, partly lying on it as the arm did when I first awoke, I could\n",
      "hardly tell it from the quilt, they so blended their hues together; and\n",
      "it was only by the sense of weight and pressure that I could tell that\n",
      "Queequeg was hugging me.\n",
      "\n",
      "My sensations were strange. Let me try to explain them. When I was a\n",
      "child, I well remember a somewhat similar circumstance that befell me;\n",
      "whether it was a reality or a dream, I never could entirely settle.\n",
      "The circumstance was this. I had been cutting up some caper or other--I\n",
      "think it was trying to crawl up the chimney, as I had seen a little\n",
      "sweep do a few days previous; and my stepmother who, somehow or other,\n",
      "was all the time whipping me, or sending me to bed supperless,--my\n",
      "mother dragged me by the legs out of the chimney and packed me off to\n",
      "bed, though it was only two o'clock in the afternoon of the 21st June,\n",
      "the longest day in the year in our hemisphere. I felt dreadfully. But\n",
      "there was no help for it, so up stairs I went to my little room in the\n",
      "third floor, undressed myself as slowly as possible so as to kill time,\n",
      "and with a bitter sigh got between the sheets.\n",
      "\n",
      "I lay there dismally calculating that sixteen entire hours must elapse\n",
      "before I could hope for a resurrection. Sixteen hours in bed! the\n",
      "small of my back ached to think of it. And it was so light too; the\n",
      "sun shining in at the window, and a great rattling of coaches in the\n",
      "streets, and the sound of gay voices all over the house. I felt worse\n",
      "and worse--at last I got up, dressed, and softly going down in my\n",
      "stockinged feet, sought out my stepmother, and suddenly threw myself\n",
      "at her feet, beseeching her as a particular favour to give me a good\n",
      "slippering for my misbehaviour; anything indeed but condemning me to lie\n",
      "abed such an unendurable length of time. But she was the best and most\n",
      "conscientious of stepmothers, and back I had to go to my room. For\n",
      "several hours I lay there broad awake, feeling a great deal worse than I\n",
      "have ever done since, even from the greatest subsequent misfortunes. At\n",
      "last I must have fallen into a troubled nightmare of a doze; and slowly\n",
      "waking from it--half steeped in dreams--I opened my eyes, and the before\n",
      "sun-lit room was now wrapped in outer darkness. Instantly I felt a shock\n",
      "running through all my frame; nothing was to be seen, and nothing was\n",
      "to be heard; but a supernatural hand seemed placed in mine. My arm hung\n",
      "over the counterpane, and the nameless, unimaginable, silent form\n",
      "or phantom, to which the hand belonged, seemed closely seated by my\n",
      "bed-side. For what seemed ages piled on ages, I lay there, frozen with\n",
      "the most awful fears, not daring to drag away my hand; yet ever thinking\n",
      "that if I could but stir it one single inch, the horrid spell would be\n",
      "broken. I knew not how this consciousness at last glided away from me;\n",
      "but waking in the morning, I shudderingly remembered it all, and for\n",
      "days and weeks and months afterwards I lost myself in confounding\n",
      "attempts to explain the mystery. Nay, to this very hour, I often puzzle\n",
      "myself with it.\n",
      "\n",
      "Now, take away the awful fear, and my sensations at feeling the\n",
      "supernatural hand in mine were very similar, in their strangeness, to\n",
      "those which I experienced on waking up and seeing Queequeg's pagan\n",
      "arm thrown round me. But at length all the past night's events soberly\n",
      "recurred, one by one, in fixed reality, and then I lay only alive to\n",
      "the comical predicament. For though I tried to move his arm--unlock his\n",
      "bridegroom clasp--yet, sleeping as he was, he still hugged me tightly,\n",
      "as though naught but death should part us twain. I now strove to rouse\n",
      "him--\"Queequeg!\"--but his only answer was a snore. I then rolled over,\n",
      "my neck feeling as if it were in a horse-collar; and suddenly felt a\n",
      "slight scratch. Throwing aside the counterpane, there lay the tomahawk\n",
      "sleeping by the savage's side, as if it were a hatchet-faced baby. A\n",
      "pretty pickle, truly, thought I; abed here in a strange house in the\n",
      "broad day, with a cannibal and a tomahawk! \"Queequeg!--in the name of\n",
      "goodness, Queequeg, wake!\" At length, by dint of much wriggling, and\n",
      "loud and incessant expostulations upon the unbecomingness of his\n",
      "hugging a fellow male in that matrimonial sort of style, I succeeded in\n",
      "extracting a grunt; and presently, he drew back his arm, shook himself\n",
      "all over like a Newfoundland dog just from the water, and sat up in bed,\n",
      "stiff as a pike-staff, looking at me, and rubbing his eyes as if he\n",
      "did not altogether remember how I came to be there, though a dim\n",
      "consciousness of knowing something about me seemed slowly dawning over\n",
      "him. Meanwhile, I lay quietly eyeing him, having no serious misgivings\n",
      "now, and bent upon narrowly observing so curious a creature. When, at\n",
      "last, his mind seemed made up touching the character of his bedfellow,\n",
      "and he became, as it were, reconciled to the fact; he jumped out upon\n",
      "the floor, and by certain signs and sounds gave me to understand that,\n",
      "if it pleased me, he would dress first and then leave me to dress\n",
      "afterwards, leaving the whole apartment to myself. Thinks I, Queequeg,\n",
      "under the circumstances, this is a very civilized overture; but, the\n",
      "truth is, these savages have an innate sense of delicacy, say what\n",
      "you will; it is marvellous how essentially polite they are. I pay this\n",
      "particular compliment to Queequeg, because he treated me with so much\n",
      "civility and consideration, while I was guilty of great rudeness;\n",
      "staring at him from the bed, and watching all his toilette motions; for\n",
      "the time my curiosity getting the better of my breeding. Nevertheless,\n",
      "a man like Queequeg you don't see every day, he and his ways were well\n",
      "worth unusual regarding.\n",
      "\n",
      "He commenced dressing at top by donning his beaver hat, a very tall one,\n",
      "by the by, and then--still minus his trowsers--he hunted up his boots.\n",
      "What under the heavens he did it for, I cannot tell, but his next\n",
      "movement was to crush himself--boots in hand, and hat on--under the bed;\n",
      "when, from sundry violent gaspings and strainings, I inferred he was\n",
      "hard at work booting himself; though by no law of propriety that I ever\n",
      "heard of, is any man required to be private when putting on his\n",
      "boots. But Queequeg, do you see, was a creature in the transition\n",
      "stage--neither caterpillar nor butterfly. He was just enough civilized\n",
      "to show off his outlandishness in the strangest possible manners. His\n",
      "education was not yet completed. He was an undergraduate. If he had not\n",
      "been a small degree civilized, he very probably would not have troubled\n",
      "himself with boots at all; but then, if he had not been still a savage,\n",
      "he never would have dreamt of getting under the bed to put them on. At\n",
      "last, he emerged with his hat very much dented and crushed down over his\n",
      "eyes, and began creaking and limping about the room, as if, not\n",
      "being much accustomed to boots, his pair of damp, wrinkled cowhide\n",
      "ones--probably not made to order either--rather pinched and tormented\n",
      "him at the first go off of a bitter cold morning.\n",

      "the utmost interest, because there were certain engrafted clerical\n",
      "peculiarities about him, imputable to that adventurous maritime life\n",

      "However, hat and coat and overshoes were one by one removed, and hung up\n",

      "he quietly approached the pulpit.\n",

      "Like most old fashioned pulpits, it was a very lofty one, and since a\n",
      "regular stairs to such a height would, by its long angle with the floor,\n",
      "seriously contract the already small area of the chapel, the architect,\n",
      "it seemed, had acted upon the hint of Father Mapple, and finished the\n",
      "pulpit without a stairs, substituting a perpendicular side ladder, like\n",
      "those used in mounting a ship from a boat at sea. The wife of a whaling\n",
      "captain had provided the chapel with a handsome pair of red worsted\n",
      "man-ropes for this ladder, which, being itself nicely headed, and\n",
      "stained with a mahogany colour, the whole contrivance, considering what\n",
      "manner of chapel it was, seemed by no means in bad taste. Halting for\n",
      "an instant at the foot of the ladder, and with both hands grasping the\n",
      "ornamental knobs of the man-ropes, Father Mapple cast a look upwards,\n",
      "and then with a truly sailor-like but still reverential dexterity, hand\n",
      "over hand, mounted the steps as if ascending the main-top of his vessel.\n",
      "\n",
      "The perpendicular parts of this side ladder, as is usually the case with\n",
      "swinging ones, were of cloth-covered rope, only the rounds were of wood,\n",
      "so that at every step there was a joint. At my first glimpse of the\n",
      "pulpit, it had not escaped me that however convenient for a ship,\n",
      "these joints in the present instance seemed unnecessary. For I was not\n",
      "prepared to see Father Mapple after gaining the height, slowly turn\n",
      "round, and stooping over the pulpit, deliberately drag up the ladder\n",
      "step by step, till the whole was deposited within, leaving him\n",
      "impregnable in his little Quebec.\n",
      "\n",
      "I pondered some time without fully comprehending the reason for this.\n",
      "Father Mapple enjoyed such a wide reputation for sincerity and sanctity,\n",
      "that I could not suspect him of courting notoriety by any mere tricks\n",
      "of the stage. No, thought I, there must be some sober reason for this\n",
      "thing; furthermore, it must symbolize something unseen. Can it be,\n",
      "then, that by that act of physical isolation, he signifies his spiritual\n",
      "withdrawal for the time, from all outward worldly ties and connexions?\n",

      "passage money how much is that?--I'll pay now.' For it is particularly\n",
      "written, shipmates, as if it were a thing not to be overlooked in this\n",

      "world, shipmates, sin that pays its way can travel freely, and without\n",
      "a passport; whereas Virtue, if a pauper, is stopped at all frontiers.\n",

      "judge him openly. He charges him thrice the usual sum; and it's assented\n",
      "to. Then the Captain knows that Jonah is a fugitive; but at the same\n",
      "time resolves to help a flight that paves its rear with gold. Yet when\n",
      "Jonah fairly takes out his purse, prudent suspicions still molest the\n",
      "Captain. He rings every coin to find a counterfeit. Not a forger, any\n",

      "enters, and would lock the door, but the lock contains no key. Hearing\n",
      "him foolishly fumbling there, the Captain laughs lowly to himself, and\n",
      "mutters something about the doors of convicts' cells being never allowed\n",
      "to be locked within. All dressed and dusty as he is, Jonah throws\n",
      "himself into his berth, and finds the little state-room ceiling almost\n",
      "resting on his forehead. The air is close, and Jonah gasps. Then, in\n",
      "that contracted hole, sunk, too, beneath the ship's water-line, Jonah\n",

      "alarms and frightens Jonah; as lying in his berth his tormented eyes\n",
      "roll round the place, and this thus far successful fugitive finds no\n",
      "refuge for his restless glance. But that contradiction in the lamp more\n",

      "the yawning jaws awaiting him; and the whale shoots-to all his ivory\n",
      "teeth, like so many white bolts, upon his prison. Then Jonah prayed unto\n",
      "the Lord out of the fish's belly. But observe his prayer, and learn a\n",

      "living gulfs of doom, and with swift slantings tore him along 'into the\n",
      "midst of the seas,' where the eddying depths sucked him ten thousand\n",

      "no desire to enlarge the circle of his acquaintances. All this struck\n",

      "she quitted the island. On one side was a coral reef; on the other a low\n",
      "tongue of land, covered with mangrove thickets that grew out into the\n",
      "water. Hiding his canoe, still afloat, among these thickets, with its\n",

      "down to \"the Moss,\" the little Nantucket packet schooner moored at the\n",
      "wharf. As we were going along the people stared; not at Queequeg\n",
      "so much--for they were used to seeing cannibals like him in their\n",
      "streets,--but at seeing him and me upon such confidential terms. But we\n",
      "heeded them not, going along wheeling the barrow by turns, and Queequeg\n",
      "now and then stopping to adjust the sheath on his harpoon barbs. I asked\n",
      "him why he carried such a troublesome thing with him ashore, and\n",
      "whether all whaling ships did not find their own harpoons. To this, in\n",
      "substance, he replied, that though what I hinted was true enough, yet\n",
      "he had a particular affection for his own harpoon, because it was of\n",
      "assured stuff, well tried in many a mortal combat, and deeply intimate\n",
      "with the hearts of whales. In short, like many inland reapers\n",
      "and mowers, who go into the farmers' meadows armed with their own\n",
      "scythes--though in no wise obliged to furnish them--even so, Queequeg,\n",
      "for his own private reasons, preferred his own harpoon.\n",
      "\n",
      "Shifting the barrow from my hand to his, he told me a funny story about\n",
      "the first wheelbarrow he had ever seen. It was in Sag Harbor. The owners\n",
      "of his ship, it seems, had lent him one, in which to carry his\n",
      "heavy chest to his boarding house. Not to seem ignorant about the\n",
      "thing--though in truth he was entirely so, concerning the precise way in\n",
      "which to manage the barrow--Queequeg puts his chest upon it; lashes it\n",
      "fast; and then shoulders the barrow and marches up the wharf. \"Why,\"\n",
      "said I, \"Queequeg, you might have known better than that, one would\n",
      "think. Didn't the people laugh?\"\n",
      "\n",
      "Upon this, he told me another story. The people of his island of\n",
      "Rokovoko, it seems, at their wedding feasts express the fragrant water\n",
      "of young cocoanuts into a large stained calabash like a punchbowl; and\n",
      "this punchbowl always forms the great central ornament on the braided\n",
      "mat where the feast is held. Now a certain grand merchant ship once\n",
      "touched at Rokovoko, and its commander--from all accounts, a very\n",
      "stately punctilious gentleman, at least for a sea captain--this\n",
      "commander was invited to the wedding feast of Queequeg's sister, a\n",
      "pretty young princess just turned of ten. Well; when all the wedding\n",
      "guests were assembled at the bride's bamboo cottage, this Captain\n",
      "marches in, and being assigned the post of honour, placed himself over\n",
      "against the punchbowl, and between the High Priest and his majesty the\n",
      "King, Queequeg's father. Grace being said,--for those people have their\n",
      "grace as well as we--though Queequeg told me that unlike us, who at such\n",
      "times look downwards to our platters, they, on the contrary, copying the\n",
      "ducks, glance upwards to the great Giver of all feasts--Grace, I say,\n",
      "being said, the High Priest opens the banquet by the immemorial ceremony\n",
      "of the island; that is, dipping his consecrated and consecrating fingers\n",
      "into the bowl before the blessed beverage circulates. Seeing himself\n",
      "placed next the Priest, and noting the ceremony, and thinking\n",
      "himself--being Captain of a ship--as having plain precedence over a\n",
      "mere island King, especially in the King's own house--the Captain coolly\n",
      "proceeds to wash his hands in the punchbowl;--taking it I suppose for a\n",
      "huge finger-glass. \"Now,\" said Queequeg, \"what you tink now?--Didn't our\n",
      "people laugh?\"\n",
      "\n",
      "At last, passage paid, and luggage safe, we stood on board the schooner.\n",
      "Hoisting sail, it glided down the Acushnet river. On one side, New\n",
      "Bedford rose in terraces of streets, their ice-covered trees all\n",
      "glittering in the clear, cold air. Huge hills and mountains of casks on\n",
      "casks were piled upon her wharves, and side by side the world-wandering\n",
      "whale ships lay silent and safely moored at last; while from others\n",
      "came a sound of carpenters and coopers, with blended noises of fires and\n",
      "forges to melt the pitch, all betokening that new cruises were on the\n",
      "start; that one most perilous and long voyage ended, only begins a\n",
      "second; and a second ended, only begins a third, and so on, for ever\n",
      "and for aye. Such is the endlessness, yea, the intolerableness of all\n",
      "earthly effort.\n",
      "\n",
      "Gaining the more open water, the bracing breeze waxed fresh; the little\n",

      "How I snuffed that Tartar air!--how I spurned that turnpike earth!--that\n",
      "common highway all over dented with the marks of slavish heels and\n",
      "hoofs; and turned me to admire the magnanimity of the sea which will\n",
      "permit no records.\n",
      "\n",
      "At the same foam-fountain, Queequeg seemed to drink and reel with me.\n",
      "His dusky nostrils swelled apart; he showed his filed and pointed teeth.\n",
      "On, on we flew; and our offing gained, the Moss did homage to the\n",
      "blast; ducked and dived her bows as a slave before the Sultan. Sideways\n",
      "leaning, we sideways darted; every ropeyarn tingling like a wire; the\n",
      "two tall masts buckling like Indian canes in land tornadoes. So full of\n",
      "this reeling scene were we, as we stood by the plunging bowsprit, that\n",
      "for some time we did not notice the jeering glances of the passengers, a\n",
      "lubber-like assembly, who marvelled that two fellow beings should be so\n",
      "companionable; as though a white man were anything more dignified than a\n",
      "whitewashed negro. But there were some boobies and bumpkins there, who,\n",
      "by their intense greenness, must have come from the heart and centre of\n",
      "all verdure. Queequeg caught one of these young saplings mimicking him\n",
      "behind his back. I thought the bumpkin's hour of doom was come. Dropping\n",
      "his harpoon, the brawny savage caught him in his arms, and by an almost\n",
      "miraculous dexterity and strength, sent him high up bodily into the air;\n",
      "then slightly tapping his stern in mid-somerset, the fellow landed with\n",
      "bursting lungs upon his feet, while Queequeg, turning his back upon him,\n",
      "lighted his tomahawk pipe and passed it to me for a puff.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Capting! Capting!\" yelled the bumpkin, running towards that officer;\n",
      "\"Capting, Capting, here's the devil.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Hallo, _you_ sir,\" cried the Captain, a gaunt rib of the sea, stalking\n",
      "up to Queequeg, \"what in thunder do you mean by that? Don't you know you\n",
      "might have killed that chap?\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"What him say?\" said Queequeg, as he mildly turned to me.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"He say,\" said I, \"that you came near kill-e that man there,\" pointing\n",
      "to the still shivering greenhorn.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Kill-e,\" cried Queequeg, twisting his tattooed face into an unearthly\n",
      "expression of disdain, \"ah! him bevy small-e fish-e; Queequeg no kill-e\n",
      "so small-e fish-e; Queequeg kill-e big whale!\"\n",
      "\n",

      "try any more of your tricks aboard here; so mind your eye.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "But it so happened just then, that it was high time for the Captain to\n",
      "mind his own eye. The prodigious strain upon the main-sail had parted\n",
      "the weather-sheet, and the tremendous boom was now flying from side to\n",
      "side, completely sweeping the entire after part of the deck. The poor\n",
      "fellow whom Queequeg had handled so roughly, was swept overboard; all\n",
      "hands were in a panic; and to attempt snatching at the boom to stay it,\n",
      "seemed madness. It flew from right to left, and back again, almost\n",
      "in one ticking of a watch, and every instant seemed on the point of\n",
      "snapping into splinters. Nothing was done, and nothing seemed capable of\n",
      "being done; those on deck rushed towards the bows, and stood eyeing the\n",
      "boom as if it were the lower jaw of an exasperated whale. In the\n",
      "midst of this consternation, Queequeg dropped deftly to his knees, and\n",
      "crawling under the path of the boom, whipped hold of a rope, secured one\n",
      "end to the bulwarks, and then flinging the other like a lasso, caught it\n",
      "round the boom as it swept over his head, and at the next jerk, the spar\n",
      "was that way trapped, and all was safe. The schooner was run into the\n",
      "wind, and while the hands were clearing away the stern boat, Queequeg,\n",
      "stripped to the waist, darted from the side with a long living arc of\n",
      "a leap. For three minutes or more he was seen swimming like a dog,\n",
      "throwing his long arms straight out before him, and by turns revealing\n",
      "his brawny shoulders through the freezing foam. I looked at the grand\n",
      "and glorious fellow, but saw no one to be saved. The greenhorn had gone\n",
      "down. Shooting himself perpendicularly from the water, Queequeg, now\n",
      "took an instant's glance around him, and seeming to see just how matters\n",
      "were, dived down and disappeared. A few minutes more, and he rose again,\n",
      "one arm still striking out, and with the other dragging a lifeless form.\n",
      "The boat soon picked them up. The poor bumpkin was restored. All hands\n",
      "voted Queequeg a noble trump; the captain begged his pardon. From that\n",
      "hour I clove to Queequeg like a barnacle; yea, till poor Queequeg took\n",
      "his last long dive.\n",
      "\n",
      "Was there ever such unconsciousness? He did not seem to think that he at\n",
      "all deserved a medal from the Humane and Magnanimous Societies. He only\n",
      "asked for water--fresh water--something to wipe the brine off; that\n",
      "done, he put on dry clothes, lighted his pipe, and leaning against the\n",
      "bulwarks, and mildly eyeing those around him, seemed to be saying\n",
      "to himself--\"It's a mutual, joint-stock world, in all meridians. We\n",

      "fine run, we safely arrived in Nantucket.\n",
      "\n",
      "Nantucket! Take out your map and look at it. See what a real corner of\n",
      "the world it occupies; how it stands there, away off shore, more lonely\n",
      "than the Eddystone lighthouse. Look at it--a mere hillock, and elbow of\n",
      "sand; all beach, without a background. There is more sand there than\n",
      "you would use in twenty years as a substitute for blotting paper. Some\n",
      "gamesome wights will tell you that they have to plant weeds there, they\n",
      "don't grow naturally; that they import Canada thistles; that they have\n",
      "to send beyond seas for a spile to stop a leak in an oil cask; that\n",

      "cross in Rome; that people there plant toadstools before their houses,\n",
      "to get under the shade in summer time; that one blade of grass makes an\n",
      "oasis, three blades in a day's walk a prairie; that they wear quicksand\n",
      "shoes, something like Laplander snow-shoes; that they are so shut up,\n",
      "belted about, every way inclosed, surrounded, and made an utter island\n",
      "of by the ocean, that to their very chairs and tables small clams will\n",
      "sometimes be found adhering, as to the backs of sea turtles. But these\n",
      "extravaganzas only show that Nantucket is no Illinois.\n",
      "\n",
      "Look now at the wondrous traditional story of how this island was\n",
      "settled by the red-men. Thus goes the legend. In olden times an eagle\n",
      "swooped down upon the New England coast, and carried off an infant\n",
      "Indian in his talons. With loud lament the parents saw their child borne\n",
      "out of sight over the wide waters. They resolved to follow in the same\n",
      "direction. Setting out in their canoes, after a perilous passage they\n",
      "discovered the island, and there they found an empty ivory casket,--the\n",
      "poor little Indian's skeleton.\n",
      "\n",
      "What wonder, then, that these Nantucketers, born on a beach, should take\n",
      "to the sea for a livelihood! They first caught crabs and quohogs in\n",
      "the sand; grown bolder, they waded out with nets for mackerel; more\n",
      "experienced, they pushed off in boats and captured cod; and at last,\n",
      "launching a navy of great ships on the sea, explored this watery world;\n",
      "put an incessant belt of circumnavigations round it; peeped in\n",
      "at Behring's Straits; and in all seasons and all oceans declared\n",
      "everlasting war with the mightiest animated mass that has survived the\n",
      "flood; most monstrous and most mountainous! That Himmalehan, salt-sea\n",
      "Mastodon, clothed with such portentousness of unconscious power, that\n",
      "his very panics are more to be dreaded than his most fearless and\n",
      "malicious assaults!\n",
      "\n",
      "And thus have these naked Nantucketers, these sea hermits, issuing from\n",
      "their ant-hill in the sea, overrun and conquered the watery world like\n",
      "so many Alexanders; parcelling out among them the Atlantic, Pacific, and\n",
      "Indian oceans, as the three pirate powers did Poland. Let America add\n",
      "Mexico to Texas, and pile Cuba upon Canada; let the English overswarm\n",
      "all India, and hang out their blazing banner from the sun; two thirds\n",
      "of this terraqueous globe are the Nantucketer's. For the sea is his; he\n",
      "owns it, as Emperors own empires; other seamen having but a right of\n",
      "way through it. Merchant ships are but extension bridges; armed ones but\n",
      "floating forts; even pirates and privateers, though following the sea\n",
      "as highwaymen the road, they but plunder other ships, other fragments of\n",
      "the land like themselves, without seeking to draw their living from the\n",

      "the sea; he alone, in Bible language, goes down to it in ships; to and\n",

      "lies his business, which a Noah's flood would not interrupt, though it\n",
      "overwhelmed all the millions in China. He lives on the sea, as prairie\n",
      "cocks in the prairie; he hides among the waves, he climbs them as\n",
      "chamois hunters climb the Alps. For years he knows not the land; so\n",
      "that when he comes to it at last, it smells like another world, more\n",
      "strangely than the moon would to an Earthsman. With the landless gull,\n",
      "that at sunset folds her wings and is rocked to sleep between billows;\n",
      "so at nightfall, the Nantucketer, out of sight of land, furls his sails,\n",

      "It was quite late in the evening when the little Moss came snugly\n",
      "to anchor, and Queequeg and I went ashore; so we could attend to no\n",
      "business that day, at least none but a supper and a bed. The landlord of\n",

      "hotels in all Nantucket, and moreover he had assured us that Cousin\n",
      "Hosea, as he called him, was famous for his chowders. In short, he\n",
      "plainly hinted that we could not possibly do better than try pot-luck at\n",

      "corner three points to the starboard, and that done, then ask the first\n",
      "man we met where the place was: these crooked directions of his very\n",
      "much puzzled us at first, especially as, at the outset, Queequeg\n",
      "insisted that the yellow warehouse--our first point of departure--must\n",
      "be left on the larboard hand, whereas I had understood Peter Coffin to\n",
      "say it was on the starboard. However, by dint of beating about a little\n",
      "in the dark, and now and then knocking up a peaceable inhabitant\n",
      "to inquire the way, we at last came to something which there was no\n",
      "mistaking.\n",
      "\n",
      "Two enormous wooden pots painted black, and suspended by asses' ears,\n",
      "swung from the cross-trees of an old top-mast, planted in front of an\n",
      "old doorway. The horns of the cross-trees were sawed off on the other\n",
      "side, so that this old top-mast looked not a little like a gallows.\n",
      "Perhaps I was over sensitive to such impressions at the time, but I\n",
      "could not help staring at this gallows with a vague misgiving. A sort of\n",
      "crick was in my neck as I gazed up to the two remaining horns; yes, TWO\n",
      "of them, one for Queequeg, and one for me. It's ominous, thinks I. A\n",
      "Coffin my Innkeeper upon landing in my first whaling port; tombstones\n",
      "staring at me in the whalemen's chapel; and here a gallows! and a pair\n",
      "of prodigious black pots too! Are these last throwing out oblique hints\n",
      "touching Tophet?\n",
      "\n",
      "I was called from these reflections by the sight of a freckled woman\n",
      "with yellow hair and a yellow gown, standing in the porch of the inn,\n",

      "making known our desires for a supper and a bed, Mrs. Hussey, postponing\n",
      "further scolding for the present, ushered us into a little room, and\n",
      "seating us at a table spread with the relics of a recently concluded\n",
      "repast, turned round to us and said--\"Clam or Cod?\"\n",

      "\"A clam for supper? a cold clam; is THAT what you mean, Mrs. Hussey?\"\n",

      "\"Queequeg,\" said I, \"do you think that we can make out a supper for us\n",
      "both on one clam?\"\n",
      "\n",
      "However, a warm savory steam from the kitchen served to belie the\n",
      "apparently cheerless prospect before us. But when that smoking chowder\n",
      "came in, the mystery was delightfully explained. Oh, sweet friends!\n",
      "hearken to me. It was made of small juicy clams, scarcely bigger than\n",
      "hazel nuts, mixed with pounded ship biscuit, and salted pork cut up into\n",
      "little flakes; the whole enriched with butter, and plentifully seasoned\n",
      "with pepper and salt. Our appetites being sharpened by the frosty\n",
      "voyage, and in particular, Queequeg seeing his favourite fishing food\n",
      "before him, and the chowder being surpassingly excellent, we despatched\n",
      "it with great expedition: when leaning back a moment and bethinking\n",
      "me of Mrs. Hussey's clam and cod announcement, I thought I would try\n",
      "a little experiment. Stepping to the kitchen door, I uttered the word\n",
      "\"cod\" with great emphasis, and resumed my seat. In a few moments the\n",
      "savoury steam came forth again, but with a different flavor, and in good\n",
      "time a fine cod-chowder was placed before us.\n",
      "\n",
      "We resumed business; and while plying our spoons in the bowl, thinks I\n",

      "What's that stultifying saying about chowder-headed people? \"But look,\n",
      "Queequeg, ain't that a live eel in your bowl? Where's your harpoon?\"\n",
      "\n",
      "Fishiest of all fishy places was the Try Pots, which well deserved\n",
      "its name; for the pots there were always boiling chowders. Chowder for\n",
      "breakfast, and chowder for dinner, and chowder for supper, till you\n",
      "began to look for fish-bones coming through your clothes. The area\n",
      "before the house was paved with clam-shells. Mrs. Hussey wore a polished\n",
      "necklace of codfish vertebra; and Hosea Hussey had his account books\n",
      "bound in superior old shark-skin. There was a fishy flavor to the milk,\n",
      "too, which I could not at all account for, till one morning happening\n",

      "\n",
      "\n",
      "In bed we concocted our plans for the morrow. But to my surprise and\n",
      "no small concern, Queequeg now gave me to understand, that he had been\n",
      "diligently consulting Yojo--the name of his black little god--and Yojo\n",
      "had told him two or three times over, and strongly insisted upon it\n",
      "everyway, that instead of our going together among the whaling-fleet in\n",
      "harbor, and in concert selecting our craft; instead of this, I say, Yojo\n",
      "earnestly enjoined that the selection of the ship should rest wholly\n",
      "with me, inasmuch as Yojo purposed befriending us; and, in order to\n",
      "do so, had already pitched upon a vessel, which, if left to myself, I,\n",
      "Ishmael, should infallibly light upon, for all the world as though it\n",
      "had turned out by chance; and in that vessel I must immediately ship\n",
      "myself, for the present irrespective of Queequeg.\n",
      "\n",
      "I have forgotten to mention that, in many things, Queequeg placed great\n",
      "confidence in the excellence of Yojo's judgment and surprising forecast\n",
      "of things; and cherished Yojo with considerable esteem, as a rather good\n",
      "sort of god, who perhaps meant well enough upon the whole, but in all\n",
      "cases did not succeed in his benevolent designs.\n",
      "\n",
      "Now, this plan of Queequeg's, or rather Yojo's, touching the selection\n",
      "of our craft; I did not like that plan at all. I had not a little relied\n",
      "upon Queequeg's sagacity to point out the whaler best fitted to carry\n",
      "us and our fortunes securely. But as all my remonstrances produced\n",
      "no effect upon Queequeg, I was obliged to acquiesce; and accordingly\n",
      "prepared to set about this business with a determined rushing sort\n",
      "of energy and vigor, that should quickly settle that trifling little\n",
      "affair. Next morning early, leaving Queequeg shut up with Yojo in our\n",
      "little bedroom--for it seemed that it was some sort of Lent or Ramadan,\n",
      "or day of fasting, humiliation, and prayer with Queequeg and Yojo that\n",
      "day; HOW it was I never could find out, for, though I applied myself\n",
      "to it several times, I never could master his liturgies and XXXIX\n",
      "Articles--leaving Queequeg, then, fasting on his tomahawk pipe, and Yojo\n",
      "warming himself at his sacrificial fire of shavings, I sallied out among\n",
      "the shipping. After much prolonged sauntering and many random inquiries,\n",
      "I learnt that there were three ships up for three-years' voyages--The\n",
      "Devil-dam, the Tit-bit, and the Pequod. DEVIL-DAM, I do not know the\n",
      "origin of; TIT-BIT is obvious; PEQUOD, you will no doubt remember, was\n",
      "the name of a celebrated tribe of Massachusetts Indians; now extinct\n",
      "as the ancient Medes. I peered and pryed about the Devil-dam; from her,\n",
      "hopped over to the Tit-bit; and finally, going on board the Pequod,\n",
      "looked around her for a moment, and then decided that this was the very\n",
      "ship for us.\n",
      "\n",
      "You may have seen many a quaint craft in your day, for aught I\n",
      "know;--square-toed luggers; mountainous Japanese junks; butter-box\n",
      "galliots, and what not; but take my word for it, you never saw such a\n",
      "rare old craft as this same rare old Pequod. She was a ship of the old\n",
      "school, rather small if anything; with an old-fashioned claw-footed look\n",
      "about her. Long seasoned and weather-stained in the typhoons and calms\n",
      "of all four oceans, her old hull's complexion was darkened like a French\n",
      "grenadier's, who has alike fought in Egypt and Siberia. Her venerable\n",
      "bows looked bearded. Her masts--cut somewhere on the coast of Japan,\n",
      "where her original ones were lost overboard in a gale--her masts stood\n",
      "stiffly up like the spines of the three old kings of Cologne. Her\n",
      "ancient decks were worn and wrinkled, like the pilgrim-worshipped\n",
      "flag-stone in Canterbury Cathedral where Becket bled. But to all these\n",
      "her old antiquities, were added new and marvellous features, pertaining\n",
      "to the wild business that for more than half a century she had followed.\n",
      "Old Captain Peleg, many years her chief-mate, before he commanded\n",
      "another vessel of his own, and now a retired seaman, and one of the\n",
      "principal owners of the Pequod,--this old Peleg, during the term of his\n",
      "chief-mateship, had built upon her original grotesqueness, and inlaid\n",
      "it, all over, with a quaintness both of material and device, unmatched\n",
      "by anything except it be Thorkill-Hake's carved buckler or bedstead. She\n",
      "was apparelled like any barbaric Ethiopian emperor, his neck heavy with\n",
      "pendants of polished ivory. She was a thing of trophies. A cannibal of\n",
      "a craft, tricking herself forth in the chased bones of her enemies. All\n",
      "round, her unpanelled, open bulwarks were garnished like one continuous\n",
      "jaw, with the long sharp teeth of the sperm whale, inserted there for\n",
      "pins, to fasten her old hempen thews and tendons to. Those thews ran not\n",
      "through base blocks of land wood, but deftly travelled over sheaves of\n",
      "sea-ivory. Scorning a turnstile wheel at her reverend helm, she sported\n",
      "there a tiller; and that tiller was in one mass, curiously carved\n",
      "from the long narrow lower jaw of her hereditary foe. The helmsman who\n",
      "steered by that tiller in a tempest, felt like the Tartar, when he holds\n",
      "back his fiery steed by clutching its jaw. A noble craft, but somehow a\n",
      "most melancholy! All noble things are touched with that.\n",
      "\n",
      "Now when I looked about the quarter-deck, for some one having authority,\n",
      "in order to propose myself as a candidate for the voyage, at first I saw\n",
      "nobody; but I could not well overlook a strange sort of tent, or\n",
      "rather wigwam, pitched a little behind the main-mast. It seemed only\n",
      "a temporary erection used in port. It was of a conical shape, some ten\n",
      "feet high; consisting of the long, huge slabs of limber black bone taken\n",
      "from the middle and highest part of the jaws of the right-whale.\n",
      "Planted with their broad ends on the deck, a circle of these slabs laced\n",
      "together, mutually sloped towards each other, and at the apex united in\n",
      "a tufted point, where the loose hairy fibres waved to and fro like the\n",
      "top-knot on some old Pottowottamie Sachem's head. A triangular opening\n",
      "faced towards the bows of the ship, so that the insider commanded a\n",
      "complete view forward.\n",
      "\n",
      "And half concealed in this queer tenement, I at length found one who\n",
      "by his aspect seemed to have authority; and who, it being noon, and\n",
      "the ship's work suspended, was now enjoying respite from the burden of\n",
      "command. He was seated on an old-fashioned oaken chair, wriggling all\n",
      "over with curious carving; and the bottom of which was formed of a\n",
      "stout interlacing of the same elastic stuff of which the wigwam was\n",
      "constructed.\n",
      "\n",
      "There was nothing so very particular, perhaps, about the appearance of\n",
      "the elderly man I saw; he was brown and brawny, like most old seamen,\n",
      "and heavily rolled up in blue pilot-cloth, cut in the Quaker style;\n",
      "only there was a fine and almost microscopic net-work of the minutest\n",
      "wrinkles interlacing round his eyes, which must have arisen from\n",
      "his continual sailings in many hard gales, and always looking to\n",
      "windward;--for this causes the muscles about the eyes to become pursed\n",
      "together. Such eye-wrinkles are very effectual in a scowl.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Is this the Captain of the Pequod?\" said I, advancing to the door of\n",
      "the tent.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Supposing it be the captain of the Pequod, what dost thou want of him?\"\n",

      "\n",
      "\"Merchant service be damned. Talk not that lingo to me. Dost see that\n",
      "leg?--I'll take that leg away from thy stern, if ever thou talkest of\n",
      "the marchant service to me again. Marchant service indeed! I suppose now\n",
      "ye feel considerable proud of having served in those marchant ships.\n",
      "But flukes! man, what makes thee want to go a whaling, eh?--it looks\n",
      "a little suspicious, don't it, eh?--Hast not been a pirate, hast\n",
      "thou?--Didst not rob thy last Captain, didst thou?--Dost not think of\n",
      "murdering the officers when thou gettest to sea?\"\n",
      "\n",
      "I protested my innocence of these things. I saw that under the mask\n",
      "of these half humorous innuendoes, this old seaman, as an insulated\n",
      "Quakerish Nantucketer, was full of his insular prejudices, and rather\n",
      "distrustful of all aliens, unless they hailed from Cape Cod or the\n",
      "Vineyard.\n",

      "\"Well, sir, I want to see what whaling is. I want to see the world.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Want to see what whaling is, eh? Have ye clapped eye on Captain Ahab?\"\n",

      "\"Who is Captain Ahab, sir?\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Aye, aye, I thought so. Captain Ahab is the Captain of this ship.\"\n",

      "\n",
      "\"Thou art speaking to Captain Peleg--that's who ye are speaking to,\n",
      "young man. It belongs to me and Captain Bildad to see the Pequod fitted\n",
      "out for the voyage, and supplied with all her needs, including crew. We\n",
      "are part owners and agents. But as I was going to say, if thou wantest\n",
      "to know what whaling is, as thou tellest ye do, I can put ye in a way of\n",
      "finding it out before ye bind yourself to it, past backing out. Clap\n",

      "\n",
      "\"Lost by a whale! Young man, come nearer to me: it was devoured,\n",
      "chewed up, crunched by the monstrousest parmacetty that ever chipped a\n",
      "boat!--ah, ah!\"\n",
      "\n",
      "I was a little alarmed by his energy, perhaps also a little touched at\n",
      "the hearty grief in his concluding exclamation, but said as calmly as I\n",
      "could, \"What you say is no doubt true enough, sir; but how could I know\n",
      "there was any peculiar ferocity in that particular whale, though indeed\n",
      "I might have inferred as much from the simple fact of the accident.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Look ye now, young man, thy lungs are a sort of soft, d'ye see; thou\n",

      "that?\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Sir,\" said I, \"I thought I told you that I had been four voyages in the\n",
      "merchant--\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Hard down out of that! Mind what I said about the marchant\n",
      "service--don't aggravate me--I won't have it. But let us understand each\n",

      "\n",
      "\"Very good. Now, art thou the man to pitch a harpoon down a live whale's\n",

      "\n",
      "\"I am, sir, if it should be positively indispensable to do so; not to be\n",

      "\n",
      "\"Good again. Now then, thou not only wantest to go a-whaling, to find\n",
      "out by experience what whaling is, but ye also want to go in order to\n",
      "see the world? Was not that what ye said? I thought so. Well then, just\n",
      "step forward there, and take a peep over the weather-bow, and then back\n",
      "to me and tell me what ye see there.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "For a moment I stood a little puzzled by this curious request, not\n",
      "knowing exactly how to take it, whether humorously or in earnest. But\n",
      "concentrating all his crow's feet into one scowl, Captain Peleg started\n",
      "me on the errand.\n",
      "\n",
      "Going forward and glancing over the weather bow, I perceived that the\n",
      "ship swinging to her anchor with the flood-tide, was now obliquely\n",
      "pointing towards the open ocean. The prospect was unlimited, but\n",
      "exceedingly monotonous and forbidding; not the slightest variety that I\n",
      "could see.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Well, what's the report?\" said Peleg when I came back; \"what did ye\n",
      "see?\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Not much,\" I replied--\"nothing but water; considerable horizon though,\n",
      "and there's a squall coming up, I think.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Well, what does thou think then of seeing the world? Do ye wish to go\n",
      "round Cape Horn to see any more of it, eh? Can't ye see the world where\n",
      "you stand?\"\n",
      "\n",
      "I was a little staggered, but go a-whaling I must, and I would; and the\n",
      "Pequod was as good a ship as any--I thought the best--and all this I now\n",
      "repeated to Peleg. Seeing me so determined, he expressed his willingness\n",
      "to ship me.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"And thou mayest as well sign the papers right off,\" he added--\"come\n",
      "along with ye.\" And so saying, he led the way below deck into the cabin.\n",
      "\n",
      "Seated on the transom was what seemed to me a most uncommon and\n",
      "surprising figure. It turned out to be Captain Bildad, who along with\n",
      "Captain Peleg was one of the largest owners of the vessel; the other\n",
      "shares, as is sometimes the case in these ports, being held by a crowd\n",
      "of old annuitants; widows, fatherless children, and chancery wards; each\n",
      "owning about the value of a timber head, or a foot of plank, or a nail\n",
      "or two in the ship. People in Nantucket invest their money in whaling\n",
      "vessels, the same way that you do yours in approved state stocks\n",
      "bringing in good interest.\n",
      "\n",
      "Now, Bildad, like Peleg, and indeed many other Nantucketers, was a\n",
      "Quaker, the island having been originally settled by that sect; and to\n",
      "this day its inhabitants in general retain in an uncommon measure the\n",
      "peculiarities of the Quaker, only variously and anomalously modified\n",
      "by things altogether alien and heterogeneous. For some of these same\n",
      "Quakers are the most sanguinary of all sailors and whale-hunters. They\n",
      "are fighting Quakers; they are Quakers with a vengeance.\n",
      "\n",
      "So that there are instances among them of men, who, named with Scripture\n",
      "names--a singularly common fashion on the island--and in childhood\n",
      "naturally imbibing the stately dramatic thee and thou of the Quaker\n",
      "idiom; still, from the audacious, daring, and boundless adventure\n",
      "of their subsequent lives, strangely blend with these unoutgrown\n",
      "peculiarities, a thousand bold dashes of character, not unworthy a\n",
      "Scandinavian sea-king, or a poetical Pagan Roman. And when these things\n",
      "unite in a man of greatly superior natural force, with a globular brain\n",
      "and a ponderous heart; who has also by the stillness and seclusion\n",
      "of many long night-watches in the remotest waters, and beneath\n",
      "constellations never seen here at the north, been led to think\n",
      "untraditionally and independently; receiving all nature's sweet or\n",
      "savage impressions fresh from her own virgin voluntary and confiding\n",
      "breast, and thereby chiefly, but with some help from accidental\n",
      "advantages, to learn a bold and nervous lofty language--that man makes\n",
      "one in a whole nation's census--a mighty pageant creature, formed for\n",
      "noble tragedies. Nor will it at all detract from him, dramatically\n",
      "regarded, if either by birth or other circumstances, he have what seems\n",
      "a half wilful overruling morbidness at the bottom of his nature. For all\n",
      "men tragically great are made so through a certain morbidness. Be sure\n",
      "of this, O young ambition, all mortal greatness is but disease. But,\n",
      "as yet we have not to do with such an one, but with quite another; and\n",
      "still a man, who, if indeed peculiar, it only results again from another\n",
      "phase of the Quaker, modified by individual circumstances.\n",
      "\n",
      "Like Captain Peleg, Captain Bildad was a well-to-do, retired whaleman.\n",
      "But unlike Captain Peleg--who cared not a rush for what are called\n",
      "serious things, and indeed deemed those self-same serious things the\n",
      "veriest of all trifles--Captain Bildad had not only been originally\n",
      "educated according to the strictest sect of Nantucket Quakerism, but all\n",
      "his subsequent ocean life, and the sight of many unclad, lovely island\n",
      "creatures, round the Horn--all that had not moved this native born\n",
      "Quaker one single jot, had not so much as altered one angle of his\n",
      "vest. Still, for all this immutableness, was there some lack of\n",
      "common consistency about worthy Captain Peleg. Though refusing, from\n",
      "conscientious scruples, to bear arms against land invaders, yet himself\n",
      "had illimitably invaded the Atlantic and Pacific; and though a sworn foe\n",
      "to human bloodshed, yet had he in his straight-bodied coat, spilled tuns\n",
      "upon tuns of leviathan gore. How now in the contemplative evening of his\n",
      "days, the pious Bildad reconciled these things in the reminiscence, I do\n",
      "not know; but it did not seem to concern him much, and very probably\n",
      "he had long since come to the sage and sensible conclusion that a man's\n",
      "religion is one thing, and this practical world quite another. This\n",
      "world pays dividends. Rising from a little cabin-boy in short clothes\n",
      "of the drabbest drab, to a harpooneer in a broad shad-bellied waistcoat;\n",
      "from that becoming boat-header, chief-mate, and captain, and finally a\n",
      "ship owner; Bildad, as I hinted before, had concluded his adventurous\n",
      "career by wholly retiring from active life at the goodly age of\n",
      "sixty, and dedicating his remaining days to the quiet receiving of his\n",
      "well-earned income.\n",
      "\n",
      "Now, Bildad, I am sorry to say, had the reputation of being an\n",
      "incorrigible old hunks, and in his sea-going days, a bitter, hard\n",
      "task-master. They told me in Nantucket, though it certainly seems a\n",
      "curious story, that when he sailed the old Categut whaleman, his crew,\n",
      "upon arriving home, were mostly all carried ashore to the hospital, sore\n",
      "exhausted and worn out. For a pious man, especially for a Quaker, he was\n",
      "certainly rather hard-hearted, to say the least. He never used to swear,\n",
      "though, at his men, they said; but somehow he got an inordinate\n",
      "quantity of cruel, unmitigated hard work out of them. When Bildad was a\n",
      "chief-mate, to have his drab-coloured eye intently looking at you, made\n",
      "you feel completely nervous, till you could clutch something--a hammer\n",
      "or a marling-spike, and go to work like mad, at something or other,\n",
      "never mind what. Indolence and idleness perished before him. His own\n",
      "person was the exact embodiment of his utilitarian character. On his\n",
      "long, gaunt body, he carried no spare flesh, no superfluous beard,\n",
      "his chin having a soft, economical nap to it, like the worn nap of his\n",
      "broad-brimmed hat.\n",
      "\n",
      "Such, then, was the person that I saw seated on the transom when I\n",
      "followed Captain Peleg down into the cabin. The space between the decks\n",
      "was small; and there, bolt-upright, sat old Bildad, who always sat so,\n",
      "and never leaned, and this to save his coat tails. His broad-brim was\n",
      "placed beside him; his legs were stiffly crossed; his drab vesture was\n",
      "buttoned up to his chin; and spectacles on nose, he seemed absorbed in\n",
      "reading from a ponderous volume.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Bildad,\" cried Captain Peleg, \"at it again, Bildad, eh? Ye have been\n",
      "studying those Scriptures, now, for the last thirty years, to my certain\n",
      "knowledge. How far ye got, Bildad?\"\n",
      "\n",
      "As if long habituated to such profane talk from his old shipmate,\n",
      "Bildad, without noticing his present irreverence, quietly looked up, and\n",
      "seeing me, glanced again inquiringly towards Peleg.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"He says he's our man, Bildad,\" said Peleg, \"he wants to ship.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Dost thee?\" said Bildad, in a hollow tone, and turning round to me.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"I dost,\" said I unconsciously, he was so intense a Quaker.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"What do ye think of him, Bildad?\" said Peleg.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"He'll do,\" said Bildad, eyeing me, and then went on spelling away at\n",
      "his book in a mumbling tone quite audible.\n",
      "\n",
      "I thought him the queerest old Quaker I ever saw, especially as Peleg,\n",
      "his friend and old shipmate, seemed such a blusterer. But I said\n",
      "nothing, only looking round me sharply. Peleg now threw open a chest,\n",
      "and drawing forth the ship's articles, placed pen and ink before him,\n",
      "and seated himself at a little table. I began to think it was high time\n",
      "to settle with myself at what terms I would be willing to engage for the\n",
      "voyage. I was already aware that in the whaling business they paid no\n",
      "wages; but all hands, including the captain, received certain shares of\n",
      "the profits called lays, and that these lays were proportioned to the\n",
      "degree of importance pertaining to the respective duties of the ship's\n",
      "company. I was also aware that being a green hand at whaling, my own\n",
      "lay would not be very large; but considering that I was used to the sea,\n",
      "could steer a ship, splice a rope, and all that, I made no doubt that\n",
      "from all I had heard I should be offered at least the 275th lay--that\n",
      "is, the 275th part of the clear net proceeds of the voyage, whatever\n",
      "that might eventually amount to. And though the 275th lay was what they\n",
      "call a rather LONG LAY, yet it was better than nothing; and if we had a\n",
      "lucky voyage, might pretty nearly pay for the clothing I would wear out\n",
      "on it, not to speak of my three years' beef and board, for which I would\n",
      "not have to pay one stiver.\n",
      "\n",
      "It might be thought that this was a poor way to accumulate a princely\n",
      "fortune--and so it was, a very poor way indeed. But I am one of those\n",
      "that never take on about princely fortunes, and am quite content if the\n",
      "world is ready to board and lodge me, while I am putting up at this grim\n",
      "sign of the Thunder Cloud. Upon the whole, I thought that the 275th lay\n",
      "would be about the fair thing, but would not have been surprised had I\n",
      "been offered the 200th, considering I was of a broad-shouldered make.\n",
      "\n",
      "But one thing, nevertheless, that made me a little distrustful about\n",
      "receiving a generous share of the profits was this: Ashore, I had heard\n",
      "something of both Captain Peleg and his unaccountable old crony Bildad;\n",
      "how that they being the principal proprietors of the Pequod, therefore\n",
      "the other and more inconsiderable and scattered owners, left nearly the\n",
      "whole management of the ship's affairs to these two. And I did not know\n",
      "but what the stingy old Bildad might have a mighty deal to say about\n",
      "shipping hands, especially as I now found him on board the Pequod,\n",
      "quite at home there in the cabin, and reading his Bible as if at his\n",
      "own fireside. Now while Peleg was vainly trying to mend a pen with his\n",
      "jack-knife, old Bildad, to my no small surprise, considering that he was\n",
      "such an interested party in these proceedings; Bildad never heeded\n",
      "us, but went on mumbling to himself out of his book, \"LAY not up for\n",
      "yourselves treasures upon earth, where moth--\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Well, Captain Bildad,\" interrupted Peleg, \"what d'ye say, what lay\n",
      "shall we give this young man?\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Thou knowest best,\" was the sepulchral reply, \"the seven hundred and\n",
      "seventy-seventh wouldn't be too much, would it?--'where moth and rust do\n",
      "corrupt, but LAY--'\"\n",
      "\n",
      "LAY, indeed, thought I, and such a lay! the seven hundred and\n",
      "seventy-seventh! Well, old Bildad, you are determined that I, for one,\n",
      "shall not LAY up many LAYS here below, where moth and rust do corrupt.\n",
      "It was an exceedingly LONG LAY that, indeed; and though from the\n",
      "magnitude of the figure it might at first deceive a landsman, yet\n",
      "the slightest consideration will show that though seven hundred and\n",
      "seventy-seven is a pretty large number, yet, when you come to make\n",
      "a TEENTH of it, you will then see, I say, that the seven hundred and\n",
      "seventy-seventh part of a farthing is a good deal less than seven\n",
      "hundred and seventy-seven gold doubloons; and so I thought at the time.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Why, blast your eyes, Bildad,\" cried Peleg, \"thou dost not want to\n",
      "swindle this young man! he must have more than that.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Seven hundred and seventy-seventh,\" again said Bildad, without lifting\n",
      "his eyes; and then went on mumbling--\"for where your treasure is, there\n",
      "will your heart be also.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"I am going to put him down for the three hundredth,\" said Peleg, \"do ye\n",
      "hear that, Bildad! The three hundredth lay, I say.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "Bildad laid down his book, and turning solemnly towards him said,\n",
      "\"Captain Peleg, thou hast a generous heart; but thou must consider the\n",
      "duty thou owest to the other owners of this ship--widows and orphans,\n",
      "many of them--and that if we too abundantly reward the labors of this\n",
      "young man, we may be taking the bread from those widows and those\n",
      "orphans. The seven hundred and seventy-seventh lay, Captain Peleg.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Thou Bildad!\" roared Peleg, starting up and clattering about the\n",
      "cabin. \"Blast ye, Captain Bildad, if I had followed thy advice in these\n",
      "matters, I would afore now had a conscience to lug about that would be\n",
      "heavy enough to founder the largest ship that ever sailed round Cape\n",
      "Horn.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Captain Peleg,\" said Bildad steadily, \"thy conscience may be drawing\n",
      "ten inches of water, or ten fathoms, I can't tell; but as thou art still\n",
      "an impenitent man, Captain Peleg, I greatly fear lest thy conscience be\n",
      "but a leaky one; and will in the end sink thee foundering down to the\n",
      "fiery pit, Captain Peleg.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Fiery pit! fiery pit! ye insult me, man; past all natural bearing, ye\n",
      "insult me. It's an all-fired outrage to tell any human creature that\n",
      "he's bound to hell. Flukes and flames! Bildad, say that again to me, and\n",
      "start my soul-bolts, but I'll--I'll--yes, I'll swallow a live goat with\n",
      "all his hair and horns on. Out of the cabin, ye canting, drab-coloured\n",
      "son of a wooden gun--a straight wake with ye!\"\n",
      "\n",
      "As he thundered out this he made a rush at Bildad, but with a marvellous\n",
      "oblique, sliding celerity, Bildad for that time eluded him.\n",
      "\n",
      "Alarmed at this terrible outburst between the two principal and\n",
      "responsible owners of the ship, and feeling half a mind to give up\n",
      "all idea of sailing in a vessel so questionably owned and temporarily\n",
      "commanded, I stepped aside from the door to give egress to Bildad, who,\n",
      "I made no doubt, was all eagerness to vanish from before the awakened\n",
      "wrath of Peleg. But to my astonishment, he sat down again on the\n",
      "transom very quietly, and seemed to have not the slightest intention of\n",
      "withdrawing. He seemed quite used to impenitent Peleg and his ways. As\n",
      "for Peleg, after letting off his rage as he had, there seemed no more\n",
      "left in him, and he, too, sat down like a lamb, though he twitched a\n",
      "little as if still nervously agitated. \"Whew!\" he whistled at last--\"the\n",
      "squall's gone off to leeward, I think. Bildad, thou used to be good at\n",
      "sharpening a lance, mend that pen, will ye. My jack-knife here needs\n",
      "the grindstone. That's he; thank ye, Bildad. Now then, my young man,\n",
      "Ishmael's thy name, didn't ye say? Well then, down ye go here, Ishmael,\n",
      "for the three hundredth lay.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Captain Peleg,\" said I, \"I have a friend with me who wants to ship\n",
      "too--shall I bring him down to-morrow?\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"To be sure,\" said Peleg. \"Fetch him along, and we'll look at him.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"What lay does he want?\" groaned Bildad, glancing up from the book in\n",
      "which he had again been burying himself.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Oh! never thee mind about that, Bildad,\" said Peleg. \"Has he ever\n",
      "whaled it any?\" turning to me.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Killed more whales than I can count, Captain Peleg.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Well, bring him along then.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "And, after signing the papers, off I went; nothing doubting but that I\n",
      "had done a good morning's work, and that the Pequod was the identical\n",
      "ship that Yojo had provided to carry Queequeg and me round the Cape.\n",
      "\n",
      "But I had not proceeded far, when I began to bethink me that the Captain\n",
      "with whom I was to sail yet remained unseen by me; though, indeed, in\n",
      "many cases, a whale-ship will be completely fitted out, and receive all\n",
      "her crew on board, ere the captain makes himself visible by arriving\n",
      "to take command; for sometimes these voyages are so prolonged, and the\n",
      "shore intervals at home so exceedingly brief, that if the captain have\n",
      "a family, or any absorbing concernment of that sort, he does not trouble\n",
      "himself much about his ship in port, but leaves her to the owners till\n",
      "all is ready for sea. However, it is always as well to have a look at\n",
      "him before irrevocably committing yourself into his hands. Turning back\n",
      "I accosted Captain Peleg, inquiring where Captain Ahab was to be found.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"And what dost thou want of Captain Ahab? It's all right enough; thou\n",
      "art shipped.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Yes, but I should like to see him.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"But I don't think thou wilt be able to at present. I don't know exactly\n",
      "what's the matter with him; but he keeps close inside the house; a sort\n",
      "of sick, and yet he don't look so. In fact, he ain't sick; but no, he\n",
      "isn't well either. Any how, young man, he won't always see me, so I\n",
      "don't suppose he will thee. He's a queer man, Captain Ahab--so some\n",
      "think--but a good one. Oh, thou'lt like him well enough; no fear, no\n",
      "fear. He's a grand, ungodly, god-like man, Captain Ahab; doesn't speak\n",
      "much; but, when he does speak, then you may well listen. Mark ye, be\n",
      "forewarned; Ahab's above the common; Ahab's been in colleges, as well as\n",
      "'mong the cannibals; been used to deeper wonders than the waves; fixed\n",
      "his fiery lance in mightier, stranger foes than whales. His lance!\n",
      "aye, the keenest and the surest that out of all our isle! Oh! he ain't\n",
      "Captain Bildad; no, and he ain't Captain Peleg; HE'S AHAB, boy; and Ahab\n",
      "of old, thou knowest, was a crowned king!\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"And a very vile one. When that wicked king was slain, the dogs, did\n",

      "\n",
      "\"Come hither to me--hither, hither,\" said Peleg, with a significance in\n",
      "his eye that almost startled me. \"Look ye, lad; never say that on board\n",
      "the Pequod. Never say it anywhere. Captain Ahab did not name himself.\n",
      "'Twas a foolish, ignorant whim of his crazy, widowed mother, who died\n",
      "when he was only a twelvemonth old. And yet the old squaw Tistig, at\n",
      "Gayhead, said that the name would somehow prove prophetic. And, perhaps,\n",
      "other fools like her may tell thee the same. I wish to warn thee. It's a\n",
      "lie. I know Captain Ahab well; I've sailed with him as mate years ago;\n",
      "I know what he is--a good man--not a pious, good man, like Bildad, but\n",
      "a swearing good man--something like me--only there's a good deal more of\n",
      "him. Aye, aye, I know that he was never very jolly; and I know that on\n",
      "the passage home, he was a little out of his mind for a spell; but it\n",
      "was the sharp shooting pains in his bleeding stump that brought that\n",
      "about, as any one might see. I know, too, that ever since he lost\n",
      "his leg last voyage by that accursed whale, he's been a kind of\n",
      "moody--desperate moody, and savage sometimes; but that will all pass\n",
      "off. And once for all, let me tell thee and assure thee, young man, it's\n",
      "better to sail with a moody good captain than a laughing bad one. So\n",
      "good-bye to thee--and wrong not Captain Ahab, because he happens to\n",
      "have a wicked name. Besides, my boy, he has a wife--not three voyages\n",
      "wedded--a sweet, resigned girl. Think of that; by that sweet girl that\n",
      "old man has a child: hold ye then there can be any utter, hopeless\n",

      "\n",
      "As I walked away, I was full of thoughtfulness; what had been\n",
      "incidentally revealed to me of Captain Ahab, filled me with a certain\n",
      "wild vagueness of painfulness concerning him. And somehow, at the time,\n",
      "I felt a sympathy and a sorrow for him, but for I don't know what,\n",
      "unless it was the cruel loss of his leg. And yet I also felt a strange\n",
      "awe of him; but that sort of awe, which I cannot at all describe, was\n",
      "not exactly awe; I do not know what it was. But I felt it; and it did\n",
      "not disincline me towards him; though I felt impatience at what seemed\n",

      "like pushing him over, so as to change his position, for it was almost\n",
      "intolerable, it seemed so painfully and unnaturally constrained;\n",
      "especially, as in all probability he had been sitting so for upwards of\n",

      "\n",
      "Closing the door upon the landlady, I endeavored to prevail upon\n",
      "Queequeg to take a chair; but in vain. There he sat; and all he could\n",
      "do--for all my polite arts and blandishments--he would not move a peg,\n",
      "nor say a single word, nor even look at me, nor notice my presence in\n",

      "yes, it's part of his creed, I suppose; well, then, let him rest; he'll\n",

      "and his Ramadan only comes once a year; and I don't believe it's very\n",
      "punctual then.\n",
      "\n",
      "I went down to supper. After sitting a long time listening to the long\n",
      "stories of some sailors who had just come from a plum-pudding voyage, as\n",
      "they called it (that is, a short whaling-voyage in a schooner or brig,\n",
      "confined to the north of the line, in the Atlantic Ocean only); after\n",
      "listening to these plum-puddingers till nearly eleven o'clock, I went\n",
      "up stairs to go to bed, feeling quite sure by this time Queequeg must\n",
      "certainly have brought his Ramadan to a termination. But no; there he\n",
      "was just where I had left him; he had not stirred an inch. I began to\n",
      "grow vexed with him; it seemed so downright senseless and insane to be\n",
      "sitting there all day and half the night on his hams in a cold room,\n",
      "holding a piece of wood on his head.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"For heaven's sake, Queequeg, get up and shake yourself; get up and have\n",
      "some supper. You'll starve; you'll kill yourself, Queequeg.\" But not a\n",
      "word did he reply.\n",
      "\n",
      "Despairing of him, therefore, I determined to go to bed and to sleep;\n",
      "and no doubt, before a great while, he would follow me. But previous to\n",
      "turning in, I took my heavy bearskin jacket, and threw it over him, as\n",
      "it promised to be a very cold night; and he had nothing but his ordinary\n",
      "round jacket on. For some time, do all I would, I could not get into\n",
      "the faintest doze. I had blown out the candle; and the mere thought\n",
      "of Queequeg--not four feet off--sitting there in that uneasy position,\n",
      "stark alone in the cold and dark; this made me really wretched. Think of\n",
      "it; sleeping all night in the same room with a wide awake pagan on his\n",
      "hams in this dreary, unaccountable Ramadan!\n",
      "\n",
      "But somehow I dropped off at last, and knew nothing more till break of\n",
      "day; when, looking over the bedside, there squatted Queequeg, as if he\n",
      "had been screwed down to the floor. But as soon as the first glimpse of\n",
      "sun entered the window, up he got, with stiff and grating joints,\n",
      "but with a cheerful look; limped towards me where I lay; pressed his\n",
      "forehead again against mine; and said his Ramadan was over.\n",
      "\n",
      "Now, as I before hinted, I have no objection to any person's religion,\n",
      "be it what it may, so long as that person does not kill or insult any\n",
      "other person, because that other person don't believe it also. But when\n",
      "a man's religion becomes really frantic; when it is a positive torment\n",
      "to him; and, in fine, makes this earth of ours an uncomfortable inn to\n",
      "lodge in; then I think it high time to take that individual aside and\n",
      "argue the point with him.\n",
      "\n",
      "And just so I now did with Queequeg. \"Queequeg,\" said I, \"get into bed\n",
      "now, and lie and listen to me.\" I then went on, beginning with the rise\n",
      "and progress of the primitive religions, and coming down to the various\n",
      "religions of the present time, during which time I labored to show\n",
      "Queequeg that all these Lents, Ramadans, and prolonged ham-squattings in\n",
      "cold, cheerless rooms were stark nonsense; bad for the health; useless\n",
      "for the soul; opposed, in short, to the obvious laws of Hygiene and\n",
      "common sense. I told him, too, that he being in other things such an\n",
      "extremely sensible and sagacious savage, it pained me, very badly pained\n",
      "me, to see him now so deplorably foolish about this ridiculous Ramadan\n",
      "of his. Besides, argued I, fasting makes the body cave in; hence the\n",
      "spirit caves in; and all thoughts born of a fast must necessarily be\n",
      "half-starved. This is the reason why most dyspeptic religionists cherish\n",
      "such melancholy notions about their hereafters. In one word, Queequeg,\n",
      "said I, rather digressively; hell is an idea first born on an undigested\n",
      "apple-dumpling; and since then perpetuated through the hereditary\n",
      "dyspepsias nurtured by Ramadans.\n",
      "\n",
      "I then asked Queequeg whether he himself was ever troubled with\n",
      "dyspepsia; expressing the idea very plainly, so that he could take it\n",
      "in. He said no; only upon one memorable occasion. It was after a great\n",
      "feast given by his father the king, on the gaining of a great battle\n",
      "wherein fifty of the enemy had been killed by about two o'clock in the\n",
      "afternoon, and all cooked and eaten that very evening.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"No more, Queequeg,\" said I, shuddering; \"that will do;\" for I knew the\n",
      "inferences without his further hinting them. I had seen a sailor who had\n",
      "visited that very island, and he told me that it was the custom, when\n",
      "a great battle had been gained there, to barbecue all the slain in the\n",
      "yard or garden of the victor; and then, one by one, they were placed\n",
      "in great wooden trenchers, and garnished round like a pilau, with\n",
      "breadfruit and cocoanuts; and with some parsley in their mouths, were\n",
      "sent round with the victor's compliments to all his friends, just as\n",
      "though these presents were so many Christmas turkeys.\n",
      "\n",
      "After all, I do not think that my remarks about religion made much\n",
      "impression upon Queequeg. Because, in the first place, he somehow seemed\n",
      "dull of hearing on that important subject, unless considered from his\n",
      "own point of view; and, in the second place, he did not more than one\n",
      "third understand me, couch my ideas simply as I would; and, finally, he\n",
      "no doubt thought he knew a good deal more about the true religion than\n",
      "I did. He looked at me with a sort of condescending concern and\n",
      "compassion, as though he thought it a great pity that such a sensible\n",
      "young man should be so hopelessly lost to evangelical pagan piety.\n",
      "\n",
      "At last we rose and dressed; and Queequeg, taking a prodigiously hearty\n",
      "breakfast of chowders of all sorts, so that the landlady should not\n",
      "make much profit by reason of his Ramadan, we sallied out to board the\n",

      "hanging to the side; and then bracing his left knee, and poising his\n",
      "harpoon, cried out in some such way as this:--\n",

      "\"Quick, Bildad,\" said Peleg, his partner, who, aghast at the close\n",

      "When all preliminaries were over and Peleg had got everything ready for\n",

      "counterpart of a queer round figure which was tattooed upon his arm; so\n",

      "one entitled \"The Latter Day Coming; or No Time to Lose,\" placed it in\n",
      "Queequeg's hands, and then grasping them and the book with both his,\n",
      "looked earnestly into his eyes, and said, \"Son of darkness, I must do my\n",

      "There was young Nat Swaine, once the bravest boat-header out of all\n",

      "it is to have the fear of death; how, then, can'st thou prate in this\n",
      "ungodly guise. Thou beliest thine own heart, Peleg. Tell me, when this\n",

      "Death and the Judgment then? What? With all three masts making such an\n",
      "everlasting thundering against the side; and every sea breaking over us,\n",
      "fore and aft. Think of Death and the Judgment then? No! no time to think\n",
      "about Death then. Life was what Captain Ahab and I was thinking of;\n",

      "\n",
      "Struck by this plain matter-of-fact question, I answered, saying, \"Yes,\n",

      "thing down; and again marking the sleeper, jocularly hinted to Queequeg\n",
      "that perhaps we had best sit up with the body; telling him to establish\n",
      "himself accordingly. He put his hand upon the sleeper's rear, as though\n",
      "feeling if it was soft enough; and then, without more ado, sat quietly\n",

      "lighted his tomahawk pipe. I sat at the feet. We kept the pipe passing\n",
      "over the sleeper, from one to the other. Meanwhile, upon questioning him\n",
      "in his broken fashion, Queequeg gave me to understand that, in his\n",
      "land, owing to the absence of settees and sofas of all sorts, the king,\n",
      "chiefs, and great people generally, were in the custom of fattening some\n",
      "of the lower orders for ottomans; and to furnish a house comfortably in\n",
      "that respect, you had only to buy up eight or ten lazy fellows, and lay\n",
      "them round in the piers and alcoves. Besides, it was very convenient on\n",
      "an excursion; much better than those garden-chairs which are convertible\n",
      "into walking-sticks; upon occasion, a chief calling his attendant, and\n",
      "desiring him to make a settee of himself under a spreading tree, perhaps\n",
      "in some damp marshy place.\n",
      "\n",
      "While narrating these things, every time Queequeg received the tomahawk\n",

      "his soul, when we were directly attracted to the sleeping rigger. The\n",
      "strong vapour now completely filling the contracted hole, it began\n",
      "to tell upon him. He breathed with a sort of muffledness; then seemed\n",

      "\"Aye, aye, ye are going in her, be ye? She sails to-day. The Captain\n",

      "well as to all appearances in port. And, as for Captain Ahab, no sign of\n",
      "him was yet to be seen; only, they said he was in the cabin. But then,\n",
      "the idea was, that his presence was by no means necessary in getting the\n",
      "ship under weigh, and steering her well out to sea. Indeed, as that was\n",
      "not at all his proper business, but the pilot's; and as he was not\n",
      "yet completely recovered--so they said--therefore, Captain Ahab stayed\n",
      "below. And all this seemed natural enough; especially as in the merchant\n",
      "service many captains never show themselves on deck for a considerable\n",
      "time after heaving up the anchor, but remain over the cabin table,\n",
      "having a farewell merry-making with their shore friends, before they\n",

      "\n",
      "But there was not much chance to think over the matter, for Captain\n",

      "commanding, and not Bildad.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Aft here, ye sons of bachelors,\" he cried, as the sailors lingered at\n",
      "the main-mast. \"Mr. Starbuck, drive'em aft.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Strike the tent there!\"--was the next order. As I hinted before, this\n",

      "Now in getting under weigh, the station generally occupied by the pilot\n",
      "is the forward part of the ship. And here Bildad, who, with Peleg, be it\n",
      "known, in addition to his other officers, was one of the licensed pilots\n",
      "of the port--he being suspected to have got himself made a pilot in\n",
      "order to save the Nantucket pilot-fee to all the ships he was concerned\n",
      "in, for he never piloted any other craft--Bildad, I say, might now\n",
      "be seen actively engaged in looking over the bows for the approaching\n",
      "anchor, and at intervals singing what seemed a dismal stave of psalmody,\n",
      "to cheer the hands at the windlass, who roared forth some sort of\n",

      "The chief mate of the Pequod was Starbuck, a native of Nantucket, and a\n",
      "Quaker by descent. He was a long, earnest man, and though born on an icy\n",
      "coast, seemed well adapted to endure hot latitudes, his flesh being hard\n",
      "as twice-baked biscuit. Transported to the Indies, his live blood would\n",
      "not spoil like bottled ale. He must have been born in some time of\n",
      "general drought and famine, or upon one of those fast days for which\n",
      "his state is famous. Only some thirty arid summers had he seen; those\n",

      "cares, than it seemed the indication of any bodily blight. It was merely\n",
      "the condensation of the man. He was by no means ill-looking; quite the\n",
      "contrary. His pure tight skin was an excellent fit; and closely wrapped\n",
      "up in it, and embalmed with inner health and strength, like a revivified\n",

      "all his hardy sobriety and fortitude, there were certain qualities\n",
      "in him which at times affected, and in some cases seemed well nigh to\n",
      "overbalance all the rest. Uncommonly conscientious for a seaman, and\n",
      "endued with a deep natural reverence, the wild watery loneliness of his\n",
      "life did therefore strongly incline him to superstition; but to that\n",
      "sort of superstition, which in some organizations seems rather to\n",
      "spring, somehow, from intelligence than from ignorance. Outward portents\n",
      "and inward presentiments were his. And if at times these things bent the\n",
      "welded iron of his soul, much more did his far-away domestic memories\n",
      "of his young Cape wife and child, tend to bend him still more from the\n",
      "original ruggedness of his nature, and open him still further to those\n",
      "latent influences which, in some honest-hearted men, restrain the gush\n",
      "of dare-devil daring, so often evinced by others in the more perilous\n",

      "the ship, like her beef and her bread, and not to be foolishly wasted.\n",
      "Wherefore he had no fancy for lowering for whales after sun-down; nor\n",

      "it was not in reasonable nature that a man so organized, and with such\n",
      "terrible experiences and remembrances as he had; it was not in nature\n",
      "that these things should fail in latently engendering an element in\n",
      "him, which, under suitable circumstances, would break out from its\n",

      "from his ears were two golden hoops, so large that the sailors called\n",

      "life of the fishery in the ships of owners uncommonly heedful of what\n",
      "manner of men they shipped; Daggoo retained all his barbaric virtues,\n",
      "and erect as a giraffe, moved about the decks in all the pomp of six\n",
      "feet five in his socks. There was a corporeal humility in looking up at\n",

      "heavily walking the deck. As the sky grew less gloomy; indeed, began to\n",

      "he seemed as unnecessary there as another mast. But the Pequod was\n",

      "might well appal me. Will he the (leviathan) make a covenant with thee?\n",
      "Behold the hope of him is vain! But I have swam through libraries and\n",
      "sailed through oceans; I have had to do with whales with these visible\n",
      "hands; I am in earnest; and I will try. There are some preliminaries to\n",
      "settle.\n",
      "\n",
      "First: The uncertain, unsettled condition of this science of Cetology\n",
      "is in the very vestibule attested by the fact, that in some quarters it\n",
      "still remains a moot point whether a whale be a fish. In his System of\n",
      "Nature, A.D. 1776, Linnaeus declares, \"I hereby separate the whales from\n",
      "the fish.\" But of my own knowledge, I know that down to the year 1850,\n",
      "sharks and shad, alewives and herring, against Linnaeus's express edict,\n",
      "were still found dividing the possession of the same seas with the\n",
      "Leviathan.\n",
      "\n",
      "The grounds upon which Linnaeus would fain have banished the whales from\n",
      "the waters, he states as follows: \"On account of their warm bilocular\n",
      "heart, their lungs, their movable eyelids, their hollow ears, penem\n",
      "intrantem feminam mammis lactantem,\" and finally, \"ex lege naturae jure\n",
      "meritoque.\" I submitted all this to my friends Simeon Macey and Charley\n",
      "Coffin, of Nantucket, both messmates of mine in a certain voyage, and\n",
      "they united in the opinion that the reasons set forth were altogether\n",
      "insufficient. Charley profanely hinted they were humbug.\n",
      "\n",
      "Be it known that, waiving all argument, I take the good old fashioned\n",
      "ground that the whale is a fish, and call upon holy Jonah to back me.\n",
      "This fundamental thing settled, the next point is, in what internal\n",
      "respect does the whale differ from other fish. Above, Linnaeus has given\n",
      "you those items. But in brief, they are these: lungs and warm blood;\n",
      "whereas, all other fish are lungless and cold blooded.\n",
      "\n",
      "Next: how shall we define the whale, by his obvious externals, so as\n",
      "conspicuously to label him for all time to come? To be short, then, a\n",
      "whale is A SPOUTING FISH WITH A HORIZONTAL TAIL. There you have\n",
      "him. However contracted, that definition is the result of expanded\n",
      "meditation. A walrus spouts much like a whale, but the walrus is not a\n",
      "fish, because he is amphibious. But the last term of the definition is\n",
      "still more cogent, as coupled with the first. Almost any one must have\n",
      "noticed that all the fish familiar to landsmen have not a flat, but a\n",
      "vertical, or up-and-down tail. Whereas, among spouting fish the tail,\n",
      "though it may be similarly shaped, invariably assumes a horizontal\n",
      "position.\n",
      "\n",
      "By the above definition of what a whale is, I do by no means exclude\n",
      "from the leviathanic brotherhood any sea creature hitherto identified\n",
      "with the whale by the best informed Nantucketers; nor, on the other\n",
      "hand, link with it any fish hitherto authoritatively regarded as alien.*\n",
      "Hence, all the smaller, spouting, and horizontal tailed fish must be\n",
      "included in this ground-plan of Cetology. Now, then, come the grand\n",
      "divisions of the entire whale host.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "*I am aware that down to the present time, the fish styled Lamatins and\n",
      "Dugongs (Pig-fish and Sow-fish of the Coffins of Nantucket) are included\n",
      "by many naturalists among the whales. But as these pig-fish are a noisy,\n",
      "contemptible set, mostly lurking in the mouths of rivers, and feeding on\n",

      "quickening humor of the Greenland Whale which the first syllable of\n",
      "the word literally expresses. In those times, also, spermaceti was\n",
      "exceedingly scarce, not being used for light, but only as an ointment\n",
      "and medicament. It was only to be had from the druggists as you nowadays\n",

      "Long-John, has been seen almost in every sea and is commonly the whale\n",
      "whose distant jet is so often descried by passengers crossing the\n",
      "Atlantic, in the New York packet-tracks. In the length he attains, and\n",
      "in his baleen, the Fin-back resembles the right whale, but is of a less\n",
      "portly girth, and a lighter colour, approaching to olive. His great lips\n",
      "present a cable-like aspect, formed by the intertwisting, slanting folds\n",
      "of large wrinkles. His grand distinguishing feature, the fin, from which\n",
      "he derives his name, is often a conspicuous object. This fin is some\n",
      "three or four feet long, growing vertically from the hinder part of the\n",
      "back, of an angular shape, and with a very sharp pointed end. Even if\n",
      "not the slightest other part of the creature be visible, this isolated\n",
      "fin will, at times, be seen plainly projecting from the surface. When\n",
      "the sea is moderately calm, and slightly marked with spherical ripples,\n",
      "and this gnomon-like fin stands up and casts shadows upon the wrinkled\n",
      "surface, it may well be supposed that the watery circle surrounding it\n",
      "somewhat resembles a dial, with its style and wavy hour-lines graved on\n",
      "it. On that Ahaz-dial the shadow often goes back. The Fin-Back is not\n",
      "gregarious. He seems a whale-hater, as some men are man-haters. Very\n",
      "shy; always going solitary; unexpectedly rising to the surface in the\n",
      "remotest and most sullen waters; his straight and single lofty jet\n",
      "rising like a tall misanthropic spear upon a barren plain; gifted with\n",
      "such wondrous power and velocity in swimming, as to defy all present\n",
      "pursuit from man; this leviathan seems the banished and unconquerable\n",
      "Cain of his race, bearing for his mark that style upon his back. From\n",
      "having the baleen in his mouth, the Fin-Back is sometimes included with\n",
      "the right whale, among a theoretic species denominated WHALEBONE WHALES,\n",
      "that is, whales with baleen. Of these so called Whalebone whales, there\n",
      "would seem to be several varieties, most of which, however, are little\n",
      "known. Broad-nosed whales and beaked whales; pike-headed whales; bunched\n",

      "\n",
      "In connection with this appellative of \"Whalebone whales,\" it is of\n",
      "great importance to mention, that however such a nomenclature may be\n",
      "convenient in facilitating allusions to some kind of whales, yet it is\n",
      "in vain to attempt a clear classification of the Leviathan, founded upon\n",
      "either his baleen, or hump, or fin, or teeth; notwithstanding that those\n",
      "marked parts or features very obviously seem better adapted to afford\n",
      "the basis for a regular system of Cetology than any other detached\n",
      "bodily distinctions, which the whale, in his kinds, presents. How\n",
      "then? The baleen, hump, back-fin, and teeth; these are things whose\n",
      "peculiarities are indiscriminately dispersed among all sorts of whales,\n",
      "without any regard to what may be the nature of their structure in other\n",
      "and more essential particulars. Thus, the sperm whale and the humpbacked\n",
      "whale, each has a hump; but there the similitude ceases. Then, this same\n",
      "humpbacked whale and the Greenland whale, each of these has baleen;\n",
      "but there again the similitude ceases. And it is just the same with the\n",
      "other parts above mentioned. In various sorts of whales, they form such\n",
      "irregular combinations; or, in the case of any one of them detached,\n",
      "such an irregular isolation; as utterly to defy all general\n",

      "\n",
      "\n",
      "Concerning the officers of the whale-craft, this seems as good a place\n",
      "as any to set down a little domestic peculiarity on ship-board, arising\n",
      "from the existence of the harpooneer class of officers, a class unknown\n",
      "of course in any other marine than the whale-fleet.\n",
      "\n",
      "The large importance attached to the harpooneer's vocation is evinced\n",
      "by the fact, that originally in the old Dutch Fishery, two centuries\n",
      "and more ago, the command of a whale ship was not wholly lodged in\n",
      "the person now called the captain, but was divided between him and an\n",
      "officer called the Specksynder. Literally this word means Fat-Cutter;\n",
      "usage, however, in time made it equivalent to Chief Harpooneer. In\n",
      "those days, the captain's authority was restricted to the navigation\n",
      "and general management of the vessel; while over the whale-hunting\n",
      "department and all its concerns, the Specksynder or Chief Harpooneer\n",
      "reigned supreme. In the British Greenland Fishery, under the corrupted\n",
      "title of Specksioneer, this old Dutch official is still retained, but\n",
      "his former dignity is sadly abridged. At present he ranks simply\n",
      "as senior Harpooneer; and as such, is but one of the captain's more\n",
      "inferior subalterns. Nevertheless, as upon the good conduct of the\n",
      "harpooneers the success of a whaling voyage largely depends, and since\n",
      "in the American Fishery he is not only an important officer in the boat,\n",
      "but under certain circumstances (night watches on a whaling ground) the\n",
      "command of the ship's deck is also his; therefore the grand political\n",
      "maxim of the sea demands, that he should nominally live apart from\n",
      "the men before the mast, and be in some way distinguished as their\n",
      "professional superior; though always, by them, familiarly regarded as\n",
      "their social equal.\n",
      "\n",
      "Now, the grand distinction drawn between officer and man at sea, is\n",
      "this--the first lives aft, the last forward. Hence, in whale-ships and\n",
      "merchantmen alike, the mates have their quarters with the captain; and\n",
      "so, too, in most of the American whalers the harpooneers are lodged in\n",
      "the after part of the ship. That is to say, they take their meals in the\n",

      "common luck, together with their common vigilance, intrepidity, and\n",
      "hard work; though all these things do in some cases tend to beget a less\n",
      "rigorous discipline than in merchantmen generally; yet, never mind\n",
      "how much like an old Mesopotamian family these whalemen may, in some\n",
      "primitive instances, live together; for all that, the punctilious\n",
      "externals, at least, of the quarter-deck are seldom materially relaxed,\n",

      "which you will see the skipper parading his quarter-deck with an elated\n",
      "grandeur not surpassed in any military navy; nay, extorting almost\n",

      "the quarter-deck; and though there were times when, owing to peculiar\n",
      "circumstances connected with events hereafter to be detailed, he\n",
      "addressed them in unusual terms, whether of condescension or IN\n",

      "Nor, perhaps, will it fail to be eventually perceived, that behind those\n",

      "legitimately intended to subserve. That certain sultanism of his brain,\n",
      "which had otherwise in a good degree remained unmanifested; through\n",

      "without the aid of some sort of external arts and entrenchments, always,\n",
      "in themselves, more or less paltry and base. This it is, that for ever\n",

      "in these small things when extreme political superstitions invest them,\n",
      "that in some royal instances even to idiot imbecility they have imparted\n",
      "potency. But when, as in the case of Nicholas the Czar, the ringed crown\n",

      "a grave peep into the binnacle, says, with some touch of pleasantness,\n",
      "\"Dinner, Mr. Stubb,\" and descends the scuttle. The second Emir lounges\n",
      "about the rigging awhile, and then slightly shaking the main brace, to\n",
      "see whether it will be all right with that important rope, he likewise\n",
      "takes up the old burden, and with a rapid \"Dinner, Mr. Flask,\" follows\n",
      "after his predecessors.\n",
      "\n",
      "But the third Emir, now seeing himself all alone on the quarter-deck,\n",
      "seems to feel relieved from some curious restraint; for, tipping all\n",
      "sorts of knowing winks in all sorts of directions, and kicking off his\n",
      "shoes, he strikes into a sharp but noiseless squall of a hornpipe right\n",
      "over the Grand Turk's head; and then, by a dexterous sleight, pitching\n",
      "his cap up into the mizentop for a shelf, he goes down rollicking so\n",
      "far at least as he remains visible from the deck, reversing all other\n",
      "processions, by bringing up the rear with music. But ere stepping into\n",
      "the cabin doorway below, he pauses, ships a new face altogether, and,\n",
      "then, independent, hilarious little Flask enters King Ahab's presence,\n",
      "in the character of Abjectus, or the Slave.\n",
      "\n",
      "It is not the least among the strange things bred by the intense\n",
      "artificialness of sea-usages, that while in the open air of the deck\n",

      "and dominion of individual influence for the time; that man's royalty of\n",

      "served. They were as little children before Ahab; and yet, in Ahab,\n",
      "there seemed not to lurk the smallest social arrogance. With one mind,\n",

      "the chief dish before him. I do not suppose that for the world they\n",

      "knife and fork, between which the slice of beef was locked, Ahab thereby\n",
      "motioned Starbuck's plate towards him, the mate received his meat as\n",
      "though receiving alms; and cut it tenderly; and a little started\n",
      "if, perchance, the knife grazed against the plate; and chewed it\n",
      "noiselessly; and swallowed it, not without circumspection. For, like\n",
      "the Coronation banquet at Frankfort, where the German Emperor profoundly\n",
      "dines with the seven Imperial Electors, so these cabin meals were\n",
      "somehow solemn meals, eaten in awful silence; and yet at table old Ahab\n",

      "to choking Stubb, when a rat made a sudden racket in the hold below. And\n",
      "poor little Flask, he was the youngest son, and little boy of this weary\n",
      "family party. His were the shinbones of the saline beef; his would have\n",
      "been the drumsticks. For Flask to have presumed to help himself, this\n",
      "must have seemed to him tantamount to larceny in the first degree. Had\n",
      "he helped himself at that table, doubtless, never more would he have\n",
      "been able to hold his head up in this honest world; nevertheless,\n",
      "strange to say, Ahab never forbade him. And had Flask helped himself,\n",
      "the chances were Ahab had never so much as noticed it. Least of all, did\n",
      "Flask presume to help himself to butter. Whether he thought the owners\n",
      "of the ship denied it to him, on account of its clotting his clear,\n",
      "sunny complexion; or whether he deemed that, on so long a voyage in such\n",
      "marketless waters, butter was at a premium, and therefore was not for\n",
      "him, a subaltern; however it was, Flask, alas! was a butterless man!\n",
      "\n",
      "Another thing. Flask was the last person down at the dinner, and Flask\n",

      "had arisen to the dignity of an officer, from that moment he had never\n",
      "known what it was to be otherwise than hungry, more or less. For what\n",
      "he ate did not so much relieve his hunger, as keep it immortal in him.\n",
      "Peace and satisfaction, thought Flask, have for ever departed from\n",
      "my stomach. I am an officer; but, how I wish I could fish a bit of\n",
      "old-fashioned beef in the forecastle, as I used to when I was before the\n",
      "mast. There's the fruits of promotion now; there's the vanity of glory:\n",
      "there's the insanity of life! Besides, if it were so that any mere\n",
      "sailor of the Pequod had a grudge against Flask in Flask's official\n",
      "capacity, all that sailor had to do, in order to obtain ample vengeance,\n",
      "was to go aft at dinner-time, and get a peep at Flask through the cabin\n",
      "sky-light, sitting silly and dumfoundered before awful Ahab.\n",
      "\n",
      "Now, Ahab and his three mates formed what may be called the first table\n",
      "in the Pequod's cabin. After their departure, taking place in inverted\n",
      "order to their arrival, the canvas cloth was cleared, or rather was\n",
      "restored to some hurried order by the pallid steward. And then the three\n",
      "harpooneers were bidden to the feast, they being its residuary legatees.\n",
      "They made a sort of temporary servants' hall of the high and mighty\n",
      "cabin.\n",
      "\n",
      "In strange contrast to the hardly tolerable constraint and nameless\n",
      "invisible domineerings of the captain's table, was the entire care-free\n",
      "license and ease, the almost frantic democracy of those inferior fellows\n",
      "the harpooneers. While their masters, the mates, seemed afraid of the\n",
      "sound of the hinges of their own jaws, the harpooneers chewed their food\n",
      "with such a relish that there was a report to it. They dined like lords;\n",
      "they filled their bellies like Indian ships all day loading with spices.\n",
      "Such portentous appetites had Queequeg and Tashtego, that to fill out\n",
      "the vacancies made by the previous repast, often the pale Dough-Boy was\n",
      "fain to bring on a great baron of salt-junk, seemingly quarried out of\n",
      "the solid ox. And if he were not lively about it, if he did not go with\n",
      "a nimble hop-skip-and-jump, then Tashtego had an ungentlemanly way of\n",
      "accelerating him by darting a fork at his back, harpoon-wise. And once\n",
      "Daggoo, seized with a sudden humor, assisted Dough-Boy's memory by\n",
      "snatching him up bodily, and thrusting his head into a great empty\n",
      "wooden trencher, while Tashtego, knife in hand, began laying out the\n",
      "circle preliminary to scalping him. He was naturally a very nervous,\n",
      "shuddering sort of little fellow, this bread-faced steward; the progeny\n",
      "of a bankrupt baker and a hospital nurse. And what with the standing\n",
      "spectacle of the black terrific Ahab, and the periodical tumultuous\n",
      "visitations of these three savages, Dough-Boy's whole life was one\n",
      "continual lip-quiver. Commonly, after seeing the harpooneers furnished\n",
      "with all things they demanded, he would escape from their clutches into\n",
      "his little pantry adjoining, and fearfully peep out at them through the\n",
      "blinds of its door, till all was over.\n",
      "\n",
      "It was a sight to see Queequeg seated over against Tashtego, opposing\n",
      "his filed teeth to the Indian's: crosswise to them, Daggoo seated on the\n",
      "floor, for a bench would have brought his hearse-plumed head to the low\n",
      "carlines; at every motion of his colossal limbs, making the low cabin\n",
      "framework to shake, as when an African elephant goes passenger in a\n",
      "ship. But for all this, the great negro was wonderfully abstemious,\n",
      "not to say dainty. It seemed hardly possible that by such comparatively\n",
      "small mouthfuls he could keep up the vitality diffused through so broad,\n",
      "baronial, and superb a person. But, doubtless, this noble savage fed\n",
      "strong and drank deep of the abounding element of air; and through his\n",
      "dilated nostrils snuffed in the sublime life of the worlds. Not by\n",
      "beef or by bread, are giants made or nourished. But Queequeg, he had a\n",
      "mortal, barbaric smack of the lip in eating--an ugly sound enough--so\n",
      "much so, that the trembling Dough-Boy almost looked to see whether\n",
      "any marks of teeth lurked in his own lean arms. And when he would hear\n",
      "Tashtego singing out for him to produce himself, that his bones might be\n",
      "picked, the simple-witted steward all but shattered the crockery hanging\n",
      "round him in the pantry, by his sudden fits of the palsy. Nor did the\n",
      "whetstone which the harpooneers carried in their pockets, for their\n",
      "lances and other weapons; and with which whetstones, at dinner, they\n",
      "would ostentatiously sharpen their knives; that grating sound did not at\n",
      "all tend to tranquillize poor Dough-Boy. How could he forget that in his\n",
      "Island days, Queequeg, for one, must certainly have been guilty of some\n",
      "murderous, convivial indiscretions. Alas! Dough-Boy! hard fares the\n",
      "white waiter who waits upon cannibals. Not a napkin should he carry on\n",
      "his arm, but a buckler. In good time, though, to his great delight,\n",
      "the three salt-sea warriors would rise and depart; to his credulous,\n",
      "fable-mongering ears, all their martial bones jingling in them at every\n",
      "step, like Moorish scimetars in scabbards.\n",
      "\n",
      "But, though these barbarians dined in the cabin, and nominally lived\n",
      "there; still, being anything but sedentary in their habits, they were\n",
      "scarcely ever in it except at mealtimes, and just before sleeping-time,\n",
      "when they passed through it to their own peculiar quarters.\n",
      "\n",
      "In this one matter, Ahab seemed no exception to most American whale\n",
      "captains, who, as a set, rather incline to the opinion that by rights\n",
      "the ship's cabin belongs to them; and that it is by courtesy alone that\n",
      "anybody else is, at any time, permitted there. So that, in real truth,\n",
      "the mates and harpooneers of the Pequod might more properly be said to\n",
      "have lived out of the cabin than in it. For when they did enter it, it\n",
      "was something as a street-door enters a house; turning inwards for\n",
      "a moment, only to be turned out the next; and, as a permanent thing,\n",
      "residing in the open air. Nor did they lose much hereby; in the cabin\n",
      "was no companionship; socially, Ahab was inaccessible. Though nominally\n",
      "included in the census of Christendom, he was still an alien to it. He\n",
      "lived in the world, as the last of the Grisly Bears lived in settled\n",
      "Missouri. And as when Spring and Summer had departed, that wild Logan of\n",
      "the woods, burying himself in the hollow of a tree, lived out the winter\n",
      "there, sucking his own paws; so, in his inclement, howling old age,\n",
      "Ahab's soul, shut up in the caved trunk of his body, there fed upon the\n",

      "CHAPTER 35. The Mast-Head.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "It was during the more pleasant weather, that in due rotation with the\n",
      "other seamen my first mast-head came round.\n",
      "\n",
      "In most American whalemen the mast-heads are manned almost\n",
      "simultaneously with the vessel's leaving her port; even though she may\n",
      "have fifteen thousand miles, and more, to sail ere reaching her proper\n",
      "cruising ground. And if, after a three, four, or five years' voyage\n",
      "she is drawing nigh home with anything empty in her--say, an empty vial\n",
      "even--then, her mast-heads are kept manned to the last; and not till her\n",
      "skysail-poles sail in among the spires of the port, does she altogether\n",
      "relinquish the hope of capturing one whale more.\n",
      "\n",
      "Now, as the business of standing mast-heads, ashore or afloat, is a very\n",
      "ancient and interesting one, let us in some measure expatiate here.\n",
      "I take it, that the earliest standers of mast-heads were the old\n",
      "Egyptians; because, in all my researches, I find none prior to them.\n",
      "For though their progenitors, the builders of Babel, must doubtless, by\n",
      "their tower, have intended to rear the loftiest mast-head in all Asia,\n",
      "or Africa either; yet (ere the final truck was put to it) as that great\n",
      "stone mast of theirs may be said to have gone by the board, in the dread\n",
      "gale of God's wrath; therefore, we cannot give these Babel builders\n",
      "priority over the Egyptians. And that the Egyptians were a nation of\n",
      "mast-head standers, is an assertion based upon the general belief among\n",
      "archaeologists, that the first pyramids were founded for astronomical\n",
      "purposes: a theory singularly supported by the peculiar stair-like\n",
      "formation of all four sides of those edifices; whereby, with prodigious\n",
      "long upliftings of their legs, those old astronomers were wont to mount\n",
      "to the apex, and sing out for new stars; even as the look-outs of a\n",
      "modern ship sing out for a sail, or a whale just bearing in sight. In\n",
      "Saint Stylites, the famous Christian hermit of old times, who built him\n",
      "a lofty stone pillar in the desert and spent the whole latter portion of\n",
      "his life on its summit, hoisting his food from the ground with a\n",
      "tackle; in him we have a remarkable instance of a dauntless\n",
      "stander-of-mast-heads; who was not to be driven from his place by fogs\n",
      "or frosts, rain, hail, or sleet; but valiantly facing everything out to\n",
      "the last, literally died at his post. Of modern standers-of-mast-heads\n",
      "we have but a lifeless set; mere stone, iron, and bronze men; who,\n",
      "though well capable of facing out a stiff gale, are still entirely\n",
      "incompetent to the business of singing out upon discovering any strange\n",
      "sight. There is Napoleon; who, upon the top of the column of Vendome,\n",
      "stands with arms folded, some one hundred and fifty feet in the air;\n",
      "careless, now, who rules the decks below; whether Louis Philippe, Louis\n",
      "Blanc, or Louis the Devil. Great Washington, too, stands high aloft on\n",
      "his towering main-mast in Baltimore, and like one of Hercules' pillars,\n",
      "his column marks that point of human grandeur beyond which few mortals\n",
      "will go. Admiral Nelson, also, on a capstan of gun-metal, stands his\n",
      "mast-head in Trafalgar Square; and ever when most obscured by that\n",
      "London smoke, token is yet given that a hidden hero is there; for\n",
      "where there is smoke, must be fire. But neither great Washington, nor\n",
      "Napoleon, nor Nelson, will answer a single hail from below, however\n",
      "madly invoked to befriend by their counsels the distracted decks\n",
      "upon which they gaze; however it may be surmised, that their spirits\n",
      "penetrate through the thick haze of the future, and descry what shoals\n",
      "and what rocks must be shunned.\n",
      "\n",
      "It may seem unwarrantable to couple in any respect the mast-head\n",
      "standers of the land with those of the sea; but that in truth it is\n",
      "not so, is plainly evinced by an item for which Obed Macy, the sole\n",
      "historian of Nantucket, stands accountable. The worthy Obed tells us,\n",
      "that in the early times of the whale fishery, ere ships were regularly\n",
      "launched in pursuit of the game, the people of that island erected lofty\n",
      "spars along the sea-coast, to which the look-outs ascended by means\n",
      "of nailed cleats, something as fowls go upstairs in a hen-house. A few\n",
      "years ago this same plan was adopted by the Bay whalemen of New Zealand,\n",
      "who, upon descrying the game, gave notice to the ready-manned boats nigh\n",
      "the beach. But this custom has now become obsolete; turn we then to the\n",
      "one proper mast-head, that of a whale-ship at sea. The three mast-heads\n",
      "are kept manned from sun-rise to sun-set; the seamen taking their\n",
      "regular turns (as at the helm), and relieving each other every two\n",
      "hours. In the serene weather of the tropics it is exceedingly pleasant\n",
      "the mast-head; nay, to a dreamy meditative man it is delightful. There\n",
      "you stand, a hundred feet above the silent decks, striding along the\n",
      "deep, as if the masts were gigantic stilts, while beneath you and\n",
      "between your legs, as it were, swim the hugest monsters of the sea, even\n",
      "as ships once sailed between the boots of the famous Colossus at old\n",
      "Rhodes. There you stand, lost in the infinite series of the sea, with\n",
      "nothing ruffled but the waves. The tranced ship indolently rolls; the\n",
      "drowsy trade winds blow; everything resolves you into languor. For the\n",
      "most part, in this tropic whaling life, a sublime uneventfulness invests\n",
      "you; you hear no news; read no gazettes; extras with startling accounts\n",
      "of commonplaces never delude you into unnecessary excitements; you hear\n",
      "of no domestic afflictions; bankrupt securities; fall of stocks; are\n",
      "never troubled with the thought of what you shall have for dinner--for\n",
      "all your meals for three years and more are snugly stowed in casks, and\n",
      "your bill of fare is immutable.\n",
      "\n",
      "In one of those southern whalesmen, on a long three or four years'\n",
      "voyage, as often happens, the sum of the various hours you spend at the\n",
      "mast-head would amount to several entire months. And it is much to be\n",
      "deplored that the place to which you devote so considerable a portion\n",
      "of the whole term of your natural life, should be so sadly destitute\n",
      "of anything approaching to a cosy inhabitiveness, or adapted to breed a\n",
      "comfortable localness of feeling, such as pertains to a bed, a hammock,\n",
      "a hearse, a sentry box, a pulpit, a coach, or any other of those small\n",
      "and snug contrivances in which men temporarily isolate themselves. Your\n",
      "most usual point of perch is the head of the t' gallant-mast, where you\n",
      "stand upon two thin parallel sticks (almost peculiar to whalemen) called\n",
      "the t' gallant cross-trees. Here, tossed about by the sea, the beginner\n",
      "feels about as cosy as he would standing on a bull's horns. To be sure,\n",
      "in cold weather you may carry your house aloft with you, in the shape of\n",
      "a watch-coat; but properly speaking the thickest watch-coat is no more\n",
      "of a house than the unclad body; for as the soul is glued inside of its\n",
      "fleshy tabernacle, and cannot freely move about in it, nor even move out\n",
      "of it, without running great risk of perishing (like an ignorant pilgrim\n",
      "crossing the snowy Alps in winter); so a watch-coat is not so much of\n",
      "a house as it is a mere envelope, or additional skin encasing you. You\n",
      "cannot put a shelf or chest of drawers in your body, and no more can you\n",
      "make a convenient closet of your watch-coat.\n",
      "\n",
      "Concerning all this, it is much to be deplored that the mast-heads of a\n",
      "southern whale ship are unprovided with those enviable little tents\n",
      "or pulpits, called CROW'S-NESTS, in which the look-outs of a Greenland\n",
      "whaler are protected from the inclement weather of the frozen seas. In\n",
      "the fireside narrative of Captain Sleet, entitled \"A Voyage among the\n",
      "Icebergs, in quest of the Greenland Whale, and incidentally for the\n",
      "re-discovery of the Lost Icelandic Colonies of Old Greenland;\" in\n",
      "this admirable volume, all standers of mast-heads are furnished with\n",
      "a charmingly circumstantial account of the then recently invented\n",
      "CROW'S-NEST of the Glacier, which was the name of Captain Sleet's good\n",
      "craft. He called it the SLEET'S CROW'S-NEST, in honour of himself; he\n",
      "being the original inventor and patentee, and free from all ridiculous\n",
      "false delicacy, and holding that if we call our own children after our\n",
      "own names (we fathers being the original inventors and patentees), so\n",
      "likewise should we denominate after ourselves any other apparatus we\n",
      "may beget. In shape, the Sleet's crow's-nest is something like a large\n",
      "tierce or pipe; it is open above, however, where it is furnished with\n",
      "a movable side-screen to keep to windward of your head in a hard gale.\n",
      "Being fixed on the summit of the mast, you ascend into it through a\n",
      "little trap-hatch in the bottom. On the after side, or side next the\n",
      "stern of the ship, is a comfortable seat, with a locker underneath for\n",
      "umbrellas, comforters, and coats. In front is a leather rack, in which\n",
      "to keep your speaking trumpet, pipe, telescope, and other nautical\n",
      "conveniences. When Captain Sleet in person stood his mast-head in this\n",
      "crow's-nest of his, he tells us that he always had a rifle with him\n",
      "(also fixed in the rack), together with a powder flask and shot, for\n",
      "the purpose of popping off the stray narwhales, or vagrant sea unicorns\n",
      "infesting those waters; for you cannot successfully shoot at them from\n",
      "the deck owing to the resistance of the water, but to shoot down upon\n",
      "them is a very different thing. Now, it was plainly a labor of love\n",
      "for Captain Sleet to describe, as he does, all the little detailed\n",
      "conveniences of his crow's-nest; but though he so enlarges upon many\n",
      "of these, and though he treats us to a very scientific account of his\n",
      "experiments in this crow's-nest, with a small compass he kept there for\n",
      "the purpose of counteracting the errors resulting from what is called\n",
      "the \"local attraction\" of all binnacle magnets; an error ascribable to\n",
      "the horizontal vicinity of the iron in the ship's planks, and in the\n",
      "Glacier's case, perhaps, to there having been so many broken-down\n",
      "blacksmiths among her crew; I say, that though the Captain is very\n",
      "discreet and scientific here, yet, for all his learned \"binnacle\n",
      "deviations,\" \"azimuth compass observations,\" and \"approximate errors,\"\n",
      "he knows very well, Captain Sleet, that he was not so much immersed\n",
      "in those profound magnetic meditations, as to fail being attracted\n",
      "occasionally towards that well replenished little case-bottle, so nicely\n",
      "tucked in on one side of his crow's nest, within easy reach of his hand.\n",
      "Though, upon the whole, I greatly admire and even love the brave, the\n",
      "honest, and learned Captain; yet I take it very ill of him that he\n",
      "should so utterly ignore that case-bottle, seeing what a faithful friend\n",
      "and comforter it must have been, while with mittened fingers and hooded\n",
      "head he was studying the mathematics aloft there in that bird's nest\n",
      "within three or four perches of the pole.\n",
      "\n",
      "But if we Southern whale-fishers are not so snugly housed aloft as\n",
      "Captain Sleet and his Greenlandmen were; yet that disadvantage is\n",
      "greatly counter-balanced by the widely contrasting serenity of those\n",
      "seductive seas in which we South fishers mostly float. For one, I used\n",
      "to lounge up the rigging very leisurely, resting in the top to have a\n",
      "chat with Queequeg, or any one else off duty whom I might find there;\n",
      "then ascending a little way further, and throwing a lazy leg over the\n",
      "top-sail yard, take a preliminary view of the watery pastures, and so at\n",
      "last mount to my ultimate destination.\n",
      "\n",
      "Let me make a clean breast of it here, and frankly admit that I kept but\n",
      "sorry guard. With the problem of the universe revolving in me, how\n",
      "could I--being left completely to myself at such a thought-engendering\n",
      "altitude--how could I but lightly hold my obligations to observe all\n",

      "Soon his steady, ivory stride was heard, as to and fro he paced his old\n",

      "But on the occasion in question, those dents looked deeper, even as\n",

      "main-mast and now at the binnacle, you could almost see that thought\n",
      "turn in him as he turned, and pace in him as he paced; so completely\n",

      "\n",
      "It drew near the close of day. Suddenly he came to a halt by the\n",

      "glancing over the bulwarks, and then darting his eyes among the crew,\n",
      "started from his standpoint; and as though not a soul were nigh him\n",
      "resumed his heavy turns upon the deck. With bent head and half-slouched\n",
      "hat he continued to pace, unmindful of the wondering whispering among\n",
      "the men; till Stubb cautiously whispered to Flask, that Ahab must have\n",

      "\n",
      "\"All ye mast-headers have before now heard me give orders about a white\n",

      "While the mate was getting the hammer, Ahab, without speaking, was\n",
      "slowly rubbing the gold piece against the skirts of his jacket, as if\n",
      "to heighten its lustre, and without using any words was meanwhile\n",
      "lowly humming to himself, producing a sound so strangely muffled and\n",
      "inarticulate that it seemed the mechanical humming of the wheels of his\n",
      "vitality in him.\n",
      "\n",
      "Receiving the top-maul from Starbuck, he advanced towards the main-mast\n",
      "with the hammer uplifted in one hand, exhibiting the gold with the\n",
      "other, and with a high raised voice exclaiming: \"Whosoever of ye\n",

      "punctured in his starboard fluke--look ye, whosoever of ye raises me\n",
      "that same white whale, he shall have this gold ounce, my boys!\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Huzza! huzza!\" cried the seamen, as with swinging tarpaulins they\n",

      "\n",
      "\"It's a white whale, I say,\" resumed Ahab, as he threw down the topmaul:\n",

      "\"Aye, aye! it was that accursed white whale that razeed me; made a poor\n",
      "pegging lubber of me for ever and a day!\" Then tossing both arms, with\n",
      "measureless imprecations he shouted out: \"Aye, aye! and I'll chase him\n",
      "round Good Hope, and round the Horn, and round the Norway Maelstrom, and\n",
      "round perdition's flames before I give him up. And this is what ye have\n",
      "shipped for, men! to chase that white whale on both sides of land, and\n",
      "over all sides of earth, till he spouts black blood and rolls fin out.\n",
      "What say ye, men, will ye splice hands on it, now? I think ye do look\n",
      "brave.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Aye, aye!\" shouted the harpooneers and seamen, running closer to the\n",

      "Moby Dick!\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"God bless ye,\" he seemed to half sob and half shout. \"God bless ye,\n",
      "men. Steward! go draw the great measure of grog. But what's this long\n",
      "face about, Mr. Starbuck; wilt thou not chase the white whale? art not\n",

      "\n",
      "\"I am game for his crooked jaw, and for the jaws of Death too, Captain\n",
      "Ahab, if it fairly comes in the way of the business we follow; but I\n",
      "came here to hunt whales, not my commander's vengeance. How many barrels\n",
      "will thy vengeance yield thee even if thou gettest it, Captain Ahab? it\n",
      "will not fetch thee much in our Nantucket market.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Nantucket market! Hoot! But come closer, Starbuck; thou requirest\n",
      "a little lower layer. If money's to be the measurer, man, and the\n",
      "accountants have computed their great counting-house the globe, by\n",
      "girdling it with guineas, one to every three parts of an inch; then, let\n",

      "\n",
      "\"He smites his chest,\" whispered Stubb, \"what's that for? methinks it\n",

      "\n",
      "\"Vengeance on a dumb brute!\" cried Starbuck, \"that simply smote thee\n",
      "from blindest instinct! Madness! To be enraged with a dumb thing,\n",
      "Captain Ahab, seems blasphemous.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Hark ye yet again--the little lower layer. All visible objects, man,\n",
      "are but as pasteboard masks. But in each event--in the living act, the\n",
      "undoubted deed--there, some unknown but still reasoning thing puts forth\n",
      "the mouldings of its features from behind the unreasoning mask. If man\n",
      "will strike, strike through the mask! How can the prisoner reach outside\n",
      "except by thrusting through the wall? To me, the white whale is that\n",
      "wall, shoved near to me. Sometimes I think there's naught beyond. But\n",
      "'tis enough. He tasks me; he heaps me; I see in him outrageous strength,\n",
      "with an inscrutable malice sinewing it. That inscrutable thing is\n",
      "chiefly what I hate; and be the white whale agent, or be the white whale\n",
      "principal, I will wreak that hate upon him. Talk not to me of blasphemy,\n",
      "man; I'd strike the sun if it insulted me. For could the sun do that,\n",
      "then could I do the other; since there is ever a sort of fair play\n",
      "herein, jealousy presiding over all creations. But not my master, man,\n",
      "is even that fair play. Who's over me? Truth hath no confines. Take off\n",
      "thine eye! more intolerable than fiends' glarings is a doltish\n",
      "stare! So, so; thou reddenest and palest; my heat has melted thee to\n",
      "anger-glow. But look ye, Starbuck, what is said in heat, that thing\n",
      "unsays itself. There are men from whom warm words are small indignity. I\n",
      "meant not to incense thee. Let it go. Look! see yonder Turkish cheeks of\n",
      "spotted tawn--living, breathing pictures painted by the sun. The Pagan\n",
      "leopards--the unrecking and unworshipping things, that live; and seek,\n",
      "and give no reasons for the torrid life they feel! The crew, man, the\n",
      "crew! Are they not one and all with Ahab, in this matter of the whale?\n",
      "See Stubb! he laughs! See yonder Chilian! he snorts to think of it.\n",
      "Stand up amid the general hurricane, thy one tost sapling cannot,\n",
      "Starbuck! And what is it? Reckon it. 'Tis but to help strike a fin; no\n",
      "wondrous feat for Starbuck. What is it more? From this one poor hunt,\n",
      "then, the best lance out of all Nantucket, surely he will not hang back,\n",
      "when every foremast-hand has clutched a whetstone? Ah! constrainings\n",
      "seize thee; I see! the billow lifts thee! Speak, but speak!--Aye, aye!\n",
      "thy silence, then, THAT voices thee. (ASIDE) Something shot from my\n",

      "cannot oppose me now, without rebellion.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"God keep me!--keep us all!\" murmured Starbuck, lowly.\n",
      "\n",
      "But in his joy at the enchanted, tacit acquiescence of the mate, Ahab\n",
      "did not hear his foreboding invocation; nor yet the low laugh from the\n",
      "hold; nor yet the presaging vibrations of the winds in the cordage;\n",
      "nor yet the hollow flap of the sails against the masts, as for a moment\n",
      "their hearts sank in. For again Starbuck's downcast eyes lighted up with\n",
      "the stubbornness of life; the subterranean laugh died away; the winds\n",
      "blew on; the sails filled out; the ship heaved and rolled as before. Ah,\n",
      "ye admonitions and warnings! why stay ye not when ye come? But\n",
      "rather are ye predictions than warnings, ye shadows! Yet not so much\n",
      "predictions from without, as verifications of the foregoing things\n",
      "within. For with little external to constrain us, the innermost\n",
      "necessities in our being, these still drive us on.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"The measure! the measure!\" cried Ahab.\n",
      "\n",

      "stood at his side with their lances, and the rest of the ship's company\n",
      "formed a circle round the group; he stood for an instant searchingly\n",
      "eyeing every man of his crew. But those wild eyes met his, as the\n",
      "bloodshot eyes of the prairie wolves meet the eye of their leader, ere\n",
      "he rushes on at their head in the trail of the bison; but, alas! only to\n",
      "fall into the hidden snare of the Indian.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Drink and pass!\" he cried, handing the heavy charged flagon to the\n",
      "nearest seaman. \"The crew alone now drink. Round with it, round! Short\n",
      "draughts--long swallows, men; 'tis hot as Satan's hoof. So, so; it\n",

      "three level, radiating lances at their crossed centre; while so doing,\n",
      "suddenly and nervously twitched them; meanwhile, glancing intently from\n",
      "Starbuck to Stubb; from Stubb to Flask. It seemed as though, by some\n",
      "nameless, interior volition, he would fain have shocked into them the\n",
      "same fiery emotion accumulated within the Leyden jar of his own magnetic\n",
      "life. The three mates quailed before his strong, sustained, and mystic\n",
      "aspect. Stubb and Flask looked sideways from him; the honest eye of\n",
      "Starbuck fell downright.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"In vain!\" cried Ahab; \"but, maybe, 'tis well. For did ye three but\n",
      "once take the full-forced shock, then mine own electric thing, THAT had\n",

      "dead. Perchance ye need it not. Down lances! And now, ye mates, I do\n",
      "appoint ye three cupbearers to my three pagan kinsmen there--yon three\n",
      "most honourable gentlemen and noblemen, my valiant harpooneers. Disdain\n",

      "\n",
      "Silently obeying the order, the three harpooneers now stood with the\n",

      "One of the wild suggestions referred to, as at last coming to be linked\n",

      "the most erudite research; so the hidden ways of the Sperm Whale\n",
      "when beneath the surface remain, in great part, unaccountable to his\n",

      "It is a thing well known to both American and English whale-ships, and\n",
      "as well a thing placed upon authoritative record years ago by Scoresby,\n",
      "that some whales have been captured far north in the Pacific, in whose\n",
      "bodies have been found the barbs of harpoons darted in the Greenland\n",

      "to man, was never a problem to the whale. So that here, in the real\n",
      "living experience of living men, the prodigies related in old times of\n",
      "the inland Strello mountain in Portugal (near whose top there was said\n",
      "to be a lake in which the wrecks of ships floated up to the surface);\n",
      "and that still more wonderful story of the Arethusa fountain near\n",
      "Syracuse (whose waters were believed to have come from the Holy Land\n",

      "go still further in their superstitions; declaring Moby Dick not only\n",
      "ubiquitous, but immortal (for immortality is but ubiquity in time); that\n",
      "though groves of spears should be planted in his flanks, he would still\n",
      "swim away unharmed; or if indeed he should ever be made to spout thick\n",

      "But even stripped of these supernatural surmisings, there was enough in\n",

      "but, as was elsewhere thrown out--a peculiar snow-white wrinkled\n",
      "forehead, and a high, pyramidical white hump. These were his prominent\n",

      "revealed his identity, at a long distance, to those who knew him.\n",
      "\n",
      "The rest of his body was so streaked, and spotted, and marbled with\n",
      "the same shrouded hue, that, in the end, he had gained his distinctive\n",
      "appellation of the White Whale; a name, indeed, literally justified by\n",
      "his vivid aspect, when seen gliding at high noon through a dark blue\n",
      "sea, leaving a milky-way wake of creamy foam, all spangled with golden\n",
      "gleamings.\n",
      "\n",
      "Nor was it his unwonted magnitude, nor his remarkable hue, nor yet his\n",

      "accounts, he had over and over again evinced in his assaults. More than\n",
      "all, his treacherous retreats struck more of dismay than perhaps aught\n",
      "else. For, when swimming before his exulting pursuers, with every\n",
      "apparent symptom of alarm, he had several times been known to turn\n",
      "round suddenly, and, bearing down upon them, either stave their boats to\n",
      "splinters, or drive them back in consternation to their ship.\n",
      "\n",
      "Already several fatalities had attended his chase. But though similar\n",
      "disasters, however little bruited ashore, were by no means unusual\n",
      "in the fishery; yet, in most instances, such seemed the White Whale's\n",
      "infernal aforethought of ferocity, that every dismembering or death\n",
      "that he caused, was not wholly regarded as having been inflicted by an\n",
      "unintelligent agent.\n",
      "\n",
      "Judge, then, to what pitches of inflamed, distracted fury the minds of\n",
      "his more desperate hunters were impelled, when amid the chips of chewed\n",
      "boats, and the sinking limbs of torn comrades, they swam out of the\n",

      "sunlight, that smiled on, as if at a birth or a bridal.\n",
      "\n",
      "His three boats stove around him, and oars and men both whirling in the\n",

      "dashed at the whale, as an Arkansas duellist at his foe, blindly seeking\n",
      "with a six inch blade to reach the fathom-deep life of the whale.\n",
      "That captain was Ahab. And then it was, that suddenly sweeping his\n",
      "sickle-shaped lower jaw beneath him, Moby Dick had reaped away Ahab's\n",
      "leg, as a mower a blade of grass in the field. No turbaned Turk, no\n",
      "hired Venetian or Malay, could have smote him with more seeming malice.\n",
      "Small reason was there to doubt, then, that ever since that almost fatal\n",
      "encounter, Ahab had cherished a wild vindictiveness against the whale,\n",
      "all the more fell for that in his frantic morbidness he at last came\n",
      "to identify with him, not only all his bodily woes, but all his\n",
      "intellectual and spiritual exasperations. The White Whale swam before\n",
      "him as the monomaniac incarnation of all those malicious agencies which\n",
      "some deep men feel eating in them, till they are left living on with\n",
      "half a heart and half a lung. That intangible malignity which has been\n",
      "from the beginning; to whose dominion even the modern Christians ascribe\n",
      "one-half of the worlds; which the ancient Ophites of the east reverenced\n",
      "in their statue devil;--Ahab did not fall down and worship it like them;\n",
      "but deliriously transferring its idea to the abhorred white whale, he\n",
      "pitted himself, all mutilated, against it. All that most maddens and\n",
      "torments; all that stirs up the lees of things; all truth with malice\n",
      "in it; all that cracks the sinews and cakes the brain; all the subtle\n",
      "demonisms of life and thought; all evil, to crazy Ahab, were visibly\n",
      "personified, and made practically assailable in Moby Dick. He piled upon\n",
      "the whale's white hump the sum of all the general rage and hate felt\n",
      "by his whole race from Adam down; and then, as if his chest had been a\n",
      "mortar, he burst his hot heart's shell upon it.\n",
      "\n",
      "It is not probable that this monomania in him took its instant rise at\n",
      "the precise time of his bodily dismemberment. Then, in darting at the\n",
      "monster, knife in hand, he had but given loose to a sudden, passionate,\n",
      "corporal animosity; and when he received the stroke that tore him, he\n",
      "probably but felt the agonizing bodily laceration, but nothing more.\n",
      "Yet, when by this collision forced to turn towards home, and for long\n",
      "months of days and weeks, Ahab and anguish lay stretched together in one\n",
      "hammock, rounding in mid winter that dreary, howling Patagonian Cape;\n",
      "then it was, that his torn body and gashed soul bled into one another;\n",
      "and so interfusing, made him mad. That it was only then, on the homeward\n",
      "voyage, after the encounter, that the final monomania seized him, seems\n",
      "all but certain from the fact that, at intervals during the passage,\n",
      "he was a raving lunatic; and, though unlimbed of a leg, yet such vital\n",
      "strength yet lurked in his Egyptian chest, and was moreover intensified\n",
      "by his delirium, that his mates were forced to lace him fast, even\n",
      "there, as he sailed, raving in his hammock. In a strait-jacket, he swung\n",
      "to the mad rockings of the gales. And, when running into more sufferable\n",
      "latitudes, the ship, with mild stun'sails spread, floated across the\n",
      "tranquil tropics, and, to all appearances, the old man's delirium seemed\n",
      "left behind him with the Cape Horn swells, and he came forth from his\n",
      "dark den into the blessed light and air; even then, when he bore that\n",
      "firm, collected front, however pale, and issued his calm orders once\n",
      "again; and his mates thanked God the direful madness was now gone; even\n",
      "then, Ahab, in his hidden self, raved on. Human madness is oftentimes a\n",
      "cunning and most feline thing. When you think it fled, it may have but\n",
      "become transfigured into some still subtler form. Ahab's full lunacy\n",
      "subsided not, but deepeningly contracted; like the unabated Hudson,\n",
      "when that noble Northman flows narrowly, but unfathomably through the\n",
      "Highland gorge. But, as in his narrow-flowing monomania, not one jot of\n",
      "Ahab's broad madness had been left behind; so in that broad madness, not\n",
      "one jot of his great natural intellect had perished. That before living\n",
      "agent, now became the living instrument. If such a furious trope may\n",
      "stand, his special lunacy stormed his general sanity, and carried it,\n",
      "and turned all its concentred cannon upon its own mad mark; so that far\n",
      "from having lost his strength, Ahab, to that one end, did now possess a\n",
      "thousand fold more potency than ever he had sanely brought to bear upon\n",
      "any one reasonable object.\n",
      "\n",
      "This is much; yet Ahab's larger, darker, deeper part remains unhinted.\n",
      "But vain to popularize profundities, and all truth is profound. Winding\n",
      "far down from within the very heart of this spiked Hotel de Cluny where\n",
      "we here stand--however grand and wonderful, now quit it;--and take your\n",
      "way, ye nobler, sadder souls, to those vast Roman halls of Thermes;\n",
      "where far beneath the fantastic towers of man's upper earth, his root\n",
      "of grandeur, his whole awful essence sits in bearded state; an antique\n",
      "buried beneath antiquities, and throned on torsoes! So with a broken\n",
      "throne, the great gods mock that captive king; so like a Caryatid, he\n",
      "patient sits, upholding on his frozen brow the piled entablatures of\n",
      "ages. Wind ye down there, ye prouder, sadder souls! question that proud,\n",

      "\n",

      "are sane, my motive and my object mad. Yet without power to kill, or\n",
      "change, or shun the fact; he likewise knew that to mankind he did long\n",
      "dissemble; in some sort, did still. But that thing of his dissembling\n",
      "was only subject to his perceptibility, not to his will determinate.\n",
      "Nevertheless, so well did he succeed in that dissembling, that when\n",
      "with ivory leg he stepped ashore at last, no Nantucketer thought him\n",

      "present voyage, sat brooding on his brow. Nor is it so very unlikely,\n",
      "that far from distrusting his fitness for another whaling voyage, on\n",
      "account of such dark symptoms, the calculating people of that prudent\n",
      "isle were inclined to harbor the conceit, that for those very reasons he\n",
      "was all the better qualified and set on edge, for a pursuit so full\n",
      "of rage and wildness as the bloody hunt of whales. Gnawed within and\n",
      "scorched without, with the infixed, unrelenting fangs of some incurable\n",
      "idea; such an one, could he be found, would seem the very man to dart\n",
      "his iron and lift his lance against the most appalling of all brutes.\n",
      "Or, if for any reason thought to be corporeally incapacitated for that,\n",

      "him, Ahab had purposely sailed upon the present voyage with the one only\n",
      "and all-engrossing object of hunting the White Whale. Had any one of his\n",
      "old acquaintances on shore but half dreamed of what was lurking in him\n",

      "Had you followed Captain Ahab down into his cabin after the squall that\n",
      "took place on the night succeeding that wild ratification of his purpose\n",
      "with his crew, you would have seen him go to a locker in the transom,\n",
      "and bringing out a large wrinkled roll of yellowish sea charts, spread\n",
      "them before him on his screwed-down table. Then seating himself before\n",
      "it, you would have seen him intently study the various lines and\n",
      "shadings which there met his eye; and with slow but steady pencil trace\n",
      "additional courses over spaces that before were blank. At intervals, he\n",
      "would refer to piles of old log-books beside him, wherein were set down\n",
      "the seasons and places in which, on various former voyages of various\n",
      "ships, sperm whales had been captured or seen.\n",
      "\n",
      "While thus employed, the heavy pewter lamp suspended in chains over his\n",
      "head, continually rocked with the motion of the ship, and for ever threw\n",
      "shifting gleams and shadows of lines upon his wrinkled brow, till it\n",
      "almost seemed that while he himself was marking out lines and courses\n",
      "on the wrinkled charts, some invisible pencil was also tracing lines and\n",
      "courses upon the deeply marked chart of his forehead.\n",
      "\n",
      "But it was not this night in particular that, in the solitude of his\n",
      "cabin, Ahab thus pondered over his charts. Almost every night they were\n",
      "brought out; almost every night some pencil marks were effaced, and\n",
      "others were substituted. For with the charts of all four oceans before\n",
      "him, Ahab was threading a maze of currents and eddies, with a view to\n",
      "the more certain accomplishment of that monomaniac thought of his soul.\n",
      "\n",
      "Now, to any one not fully acquainted with the ways of the leviathans,\n",
      "it might seem an absurdly hopeless task thus to seek out one solitary\n",
      "creature in the unhooped oceans of this planet. But not so did it\n",
      "seem to Ahab, who knew the sets of all tides and currents; and thereby\n",

      "then the migrations of the sperm whale would be found to correspond in\n",
      "invariability to those of the herring-shoals or the flights of swallows.\n",

      "\n",
      "     *Since the above was written, the statement is happily borne\n",
      "     out by an official circular, issued by Lieutenant Maury, of\n",
      "     the National Observatory, Washington, April 16th, 1851. By\n",
      "     that circular, it appears that precisely such a chart is in\n",
      "     course of completion; and portions of it are presented in\n",
      "     the circular. \"This chart divides the ocean into districts\n",
      "     of five degrees of latitude by five degrees of longitude;\n",
      "     perpendicularly through each of which districts are twelve\n",
      "     columns for the twelve months; and horizontally through each\n",
      "     of which districts are three lines; one to show the number\n",
      "     of days that have been spent in each month in every\n",
      "     district, and the two others to show the number of days in\n",
      "     which whales, sperm or right, have been seen.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "Besides, when making a passage from one feeding-ground to another, the\n",
      "sperm whales, guided by some infallible instinct--say, rather, secret\n",
      "intelligence from the Deity--mostly swim in VEINS, as they are called;\n",
      "continuing their way along a given ocean-line with such undeviating\n",
      "exactitude, that no ship ever sailed her course, by any chart, with\n",
      "one tithe of such marvellous precision. Though, in these cases, the\n",
      "direction taken by any one whale be straight as a surveyor's parallel,\n",
      "and though the line of advance be strictly confined to its own\n",
      "unavoidable, straight wake, yet the arbitrary VEIN in which at these\n",
      "times he is said to swim, generally embraces some few miles in width\n",
      "(more or less, as the vein is presumed to expand or contract); but\n",
      "never exceeds the visual sweep from the whale-ship's mast-heads,\n",
      "when circumspectly gliding along this magic zone. The sum is, that at\n",
      "particular seasons within that breadth and along that path, migrating\n",
      "whales may with great confidence be looked for.\n",
      "\n",
      "And hence not only at substantiated times, upon well known separate\n",
      "feeding-grounds, could Ahab hope to encounter his prey; but in crossing\n",
      "the widest expanses of water between those grounds he could, by his\n",
      "art, so place and time himself on his way, as even then not to be wholly\n",
      "without prospect of a meeting.\n",
      "\n",
      "There was a circumstance which at first sight seemed to entangle his\n",
      "delirious but still methodical scheme. But not so in the reality,\n",
      "perhaps. Though the gregarious sperm whales have their regular seasons\n",
      "for particular grounds, yet in general you cannot conclude that the\n",
      "herds which haunted such and such a latitude or longitude this year,\n",
      "say, will turn out to be identically the same with those that were found\n",
      "there the preceding season; though there are peculiar and unquestionable\n",
      "instances where the contrary of this has proved true. In general, the\n",
      "same remark, only within a less wide limit, applies to the solitaries\n",
      "and hermits among the matured, aged sperm whales. So that though Moby\n",
      "Dick had in a former year been seen, for example, on what is called the\n",
      "Seychelle ground in the Indian ocean, or Volcano Bay on the Japanese\n",
      "Coast; yet it did not follow, that were the Pequod to visit either of\n",
      "those spots at any subsequent corresponding season, she would infallibly\n",
      "encounter him there. So, too, with some other feeding grounds, where\n",
      "he had at times revealed himself. But all these seemed only his casual\n",
      "stopping-places and ocean-inns, so to speak, not his places of prolonged\n",
      "abode. And where Ahab's chances of accomplishing his object have\n",
      "hitherto been spoken of, allusion has only been made to whatever\n",
      "way-side, antecedent, extra prospects were his, ere a particular\n",
      "set time or place were attained, when all possibilities would become\n",
      "probabilities, and, as Ahab fondly thought, every possibility the next\n",
      "thing to a certainty. That particular set time and place were conjoined\n",
      "in the one technical phrase--the Season-on-the-Line. For there and then,\n",
      "for several consecutive years, Moby Dick had been periodically descried,\n",
      "lingering in those waters for awhile, as the sun, in its annual round,\n",
      "loiters for a predicted interval in any one sign of the Zodiac. There\n",
      "it was, too, that most of the deadly encounters with the white whale had\n",
      "taken place; there the waves were storied with his deeds; there also was\n",
      "that tragic spot where the monomaniac old man had found the awful motive\n",
      "to his vengeance. But in the cautious comprehensiveness and unloitering\n",
      "vigilance with which Ahab threw his brooding soul into this unfaltering\n",
      "hunt, he would not permit himself to rest all his hopes upon the one\n",
      "crowning fact above mentioned, however flattering it might be to those\n",
      "hopes; nor in the sleeplessness of his vow could he so tranquillize his\n",
      "unquiet heart as to postpone all intervening quest.\n",
      "\n",
      "Now, the Pequod had sailed from Nantucket at the very beginning of the\n",
      "Season-on-the-Line. No possible endeavor then could enable her commander\n",
      "to make the great passage southwards, double Cape Horn, and then running\n",
      "down sixty degrees of latitude arrive in the equatorial Pacific in time\n",
      "to cruise there. Therefore, he must wait for the next ensuing season.\n",
      "Yet the premature hour of the Pequod's sailing had, perhaps, been\n",
      "correctly selected by Ahab, with a view to this very complexion of\n",
      "things. Because, an interval of three hundred and sixty-five days\n",
      "and nights was before him; an interval which, instead of impatiently\n",
      "enduring ashore, he would spend in a miscellaneous hunt; if by chance\n",
      "the White Whale, spending his vacation in seas far remote from his\n",
      "periodical feeding-grounds, should turn up his wrinkled brow off the\n",
      "Persian Gulf, or in the Bengal Bay, or China Seas, or in any other\n",
      "waters haunted by his race. So that Monsoons, Pampas, Nor'-Westers,\n",
      "Harmattans, Trades; any wind but the Levanter and Simoon, might\n",
      "blow Moby Dick into the devious zig-zag world-circle of the Pequod's\n",
      "circumnavigating wake.\n",
      "\n",
      "But granting all this; yet, regarded discreetly and coolly, seems it not\n",
      "but a mad idea, this; that in the broad boundless ocean, one solitary\n",
      "whale, even if encountered, should be thought capable of individual\n",
      "recognition from his hunter, even as a white-bearded Mufti in the\n",
      "thronged thoroughfares of Constantinople? Yes. For the peculiar\n",
      "snow-white brow of Moby Dick, and his snow-white hump, could not but\n",
      "be unmistakable. And have I not tallied the whale, Ahab would mutter\n",
      "to himself, as after poring over his charts till long after midnight he\n",
      "would throw himself back in reveries--tallied him, and shall he escape?\n",
      "His broad fins are bored, and scalloped out like a lost sheep's ear! And\n",
      "here, his mad mind would run on in a breathless race; till a weariness\n",
      "and faintness of pondering came over him; and in the open air of the\n",
      "deck he would seek to recover his strength. Ah, God! what trances\n",
      "of torments does that man endure who is consumed with one unachieved\n",
      "revengeful desire. He sleeps with clenched hands; and wakes with his own\n",
      "bloody nails in his palms.\n",
      "\n",
      "Often, when forced from his hammock by exhausting and intolerably vivid\n",
      "dreams of the night, which, resuming his own intense thoughts through\n",
      "the day, carried them on amid a clashing of phrensies, and whirled them\n",
      "round and round and round in his blazing brain, till the very throbbing\n",
      "of his life-spot became insufferable anguish; and when, as was sometimes\n",
      "the case, these spiritual throes in him heaved his being up from its\n",
      "base, and a chasm seemed opening in him, from which forked flames and\n",
      "lightnings shot up, and accursed fiends beckoned him to leap down among\n",
      "them; when this hell in himself yawned beneath him, a wild cry would be\n",
      "heard through the ship; and with glaring eyes Ahab would burst from his\n",
      "state room, as though escaping from a bed that was on fire. Yet these,\n",
      "perhaps, instead of being the unsuppressable symptoms of some latent\n",
      "weakness, or fright at his own resolve, were but the plainest tokens\n",
      "of its intensity. For, at such times, crazy Ahab, the scheming,\n",
      "unappeasedly steadfast hunter of the white whale; this Ahab that had\n",
      "gone to his hammock, was not the agent that so caused him to burst from\n",
      "it in horror again. The latter was the eternal, living principle or\n",
      "soul in him; and in sleep, being for the time dissociated from the\n",
      "characterizing mind, which at other times employed it for its outer\n",
      "vehicle or agent, it spontaneously sought escape from the scorching\n",
      "contiguity of the frantic thing, of which, for the time, it was no\n",
      "longer an integral. But as the mind does not exist unless leagued with\n",
      "the soul, therefore it must have been that, in Ahab's case, yielding up\n",
      "all his thoughts and fancies to his one supreme purpose; that purpose,\n",
      "by its own sheer inveteracy of will, forced itself against gods and\n",
      "devils into a kind of self-assumed, independent being of its own. Nay,\n",
      "could grimly live and burn, while the common vitality to which it was\n",
      "conjoined, fled horror-stricken from the unbidden and unfathered birth.\n",
      "Therefore, the tormented spirit that glared out of bodily eyes, when\n",
      "what seemed Ahab rushed from his room, was for the time but a vacated\n",
      "thing, a formless somnambulistic being, a ray of living light, to be\n",
      "sure, but without an object to colour, and therefore a blankness in\n",
      "itself. God help thee, old man, thy thoughts have created a creature\n",

      "citations, I take it--the conclusion aimed at will naturally follow of\n",
      "itself.\n",
      "\n",
      "First: I have personally known three instances where a whale, after\n",
      "receiving a harpoon, has effected a complete escape; and, after an\n",
      "interval (in one instance of three years), has been again struck by\n",
      "the same hand, and slain; when the two irons, both marked by the same\n",
      "private cypher, have been taken from the body. In the instance where\n",
      "three years intervened between the flinging of the two harpoons; and I\n",
      "think it may have been something more than that; the man who darted\n",
      "them happening, in the interval, to go in a trading ship on a voyage to\n",
      "Africa, went ashore there, joined a discovery party, and penetrated far\n",
      "into the interior, where he travelled for a period of nearly two years,\n",
      "often endangered by serpents, savages, tigers, poisonous miasmas,\n",
      "with all the other common perils incident to wandering in the heart of\n",
      "unknown regions. Meanwhile, the whale he had struck must also have\n",
      "been on its travels; no doubt it had thrice circumnavigated the globe,\n",
      "brushing with its flanks all the coasts of Africa; but to no purpose.\n",
      "This man and this whale again came together, and the one vanquished the\n",
      "other. I say I, myself, have known three instances similar to this; that\n",
      "is in two of them I saw the whales struck; and, upon the second attack,\n",
      "saw the two irons with the respective marks cut in them, afterwards\n",
      "taken from the dead fish. In the three-year instance, it so fell out\n",
      "that I was in the boat both times, first and last, and the last time\n",
      "distinctly recognised a peculiar sort of huge mole under the whale's\n",
      "eye, which I had observed there three years previous. I say three years,\n",
      "but I am pretty sure it was more than that. Here are three instances,\n",
      "then, which I personally know the truth of; but I have heard of many\n",
      "other instances from persons whose veracity in the matter there is no\n",
      "good ground to impeach.\n",
      "\n",
      "Secondly: It is well known in the Sperm Whale Fishery, however ignorant\n",
      "the world ashore may be of it, that there have been several memorable\n",
      "historical instances where a particular whale in the ocean has been at\n",
      "distant times and places popularly cognisable. Why such a whale became\n",
      "thus marked was not altogether and originally owing to his bodily\n",
      "peculiarities as distinguished from other whales; for however peculiar\n",
      "in that respect any chance whale may be, they soon put an end to his\n",
      "peculiarities by killing him, and boiling him down into a peculiarly\n",
      "valuable oil. No: the reason was this: that from the fatal experiences\n",
      "of the fishery there hung a terrible prestige of perilousness about\n",
      "such a whale as there did about Rinaldo Rinaldini, insomuch that\n",
      "most fishermen were content to recognise him by merely touching their\n",
      "tarpaulins when he would be discovered lounging by them on the sea,\n",
      "without seeking to cultivate a more intimate acquaintance. Like some\n",

      "malicious, as with direct aforethought to stave in, utterly destroy, and\n",
      "sink a large ship; and what is more, the Sperm Whale HAS done it.\n",
      "\n",
      "First: In the year 1820 the ship Essex, Captain Pollard, of Nantucket,\n",
      "was cruising in the Pacific Ocean. One day she saw spouts, lowered her\n",
      "boats, and gave chase to a shoal of sperm whales. Ere long, several of\n",
      "the whales were wounded; when, suddenly, a very large whale escaping\n",
      "from the boats, issued from the shoal, and bore directly down upon the\n",
      "ship. Dashing his forehead against her hull, he so stove her in, that in\n",
      "less than \"ten minutes\" she settled down and fell over. Not a surviving\n",
      "plank of her has been seen since. After the severest exposure, part of\n",
      "the crew reached the land in their boats. Being returned home at last,\n",
      "Captain Pollard once more sailed for the Pacific in command of another\n",
      "ship, but the gods shipwrecked him again upon unknown rocks and\n",
      "breakers; for the second time his ship was utterly lost, and forthwith\n",
      "forswearing the sea, he has never tempted it since. At this day Captain\n",
      "Pollard is a resident of Nantucket. I have seen Owen Chace, who was\n",
      "chief mate of the Essex at the time of the tragedy; I have read his\n",
      "plain and faithful narrative; I have conversed with his son; and all\n",
      "this within a few miles of the scene of the catastrophe.*\n",
      "\n",

      "*The following are extracts from Chace's narrative: \"Every fact seemed\n",

      "a short interval between them, both of which, according to their\n",
      "direction, were calculated to do us the most injury, by being made\n",
      "ahead, and thereby combining the speed of the two objects for the shock;\n",
      "to effect which, the exact manoeuvres which he made were necessary. His\n",
      "aspect was most horrible, and such as indicated resentment and fury. He\n",
      "came directly from the shoal which we had just before entered, and in\n",
      "which we had struck three of his companions, as if fired with revenge\n",
      "for their sufferings.\" Again: \"At all events, the whole circumstances\n",
      "taken together, all happening before my own eyes, and producing, at the\n",
      "time, impressions in my mind of decided, calculating mischief, on the\n",

      "fears of being swallowed up by some dreadful tempest, or dashed\n",
      "upon hidden rocks, with all the other ordinary subjects of fearful\n",
      "contemplation, seemed scarcely entitled to a moment's thought; the\n",

      "clear and fine, but so intolerably cold that we were obliged to keep on\n",
      "our fur clothing. For some days we had very little wind; it was not\n",
      "till the nineteenth that a brisk gale from the northwest sprang up. An\n",
      "uncommon large whale, the body of which was larger than the ship itself,\n",
      "lay almost at the surface of the water, but was not perceived by any\n",
      "one on board till the moment when the ship, which was in full sail,\n",
      "was almost upon him, so that it was impossible to prevent its striking\n",
      "against him. We were thus placed in the most imminent danger, as this\n",
      "gigantic creature, setting up its back, raised the ship three feet at\n",
      "least out of the water. The masts reeled, and the sails fell altogether,\n",
      "while we who were below all sprang instantly upon the deck, concluding\n",
      "that we had struck upon some rock; instead of this we saw the monster\n",
      "sailing off with the utmost gravity and solemnity. Captain D'Wolf\n",
      "applied immediately to the pumps to examine whether or not the vessel\n",
      "had received any damage from the shock, but we found that very happily\n",
      "it had escaped entirely uninjured.\"\n",

      "men in such consternation that they could hardly tell where they were\n",
      "or what to think; but every one began to prepare for death. And, indeed,\n",
      "the shock was so sudden and violent, that we took it for granted the\n",
      "ship had struck against a rock; but when the amazement was a little\n",
      "over, we cast the lead, and sounded, but found no ground..... The\n",
      "suddenness of the shock made the guns leap in their carriages, and\n",
      "several of the men were shaken out of their hammocks. Captain Davis, who\n",
      "lay with his head on a gun, was thrown out of his cabin!\" Lionel then\n",
      "goes on to impute the shock to an earthquake, and seems to substantiate\n",
      "the imputation by stating that a great earthquake, somewhere about\n",
      "that time, did actually do great mischief along the Spanish land. But\n",
      "I should not much wonder if, in the darkness of that early hour of the\n",

      "I might proceed with several more examples, one way or another known to\n",
      "me, of the great power and malice at times of the sperm whale. In more\n",
      "than one instance, he has been known, not only to chase the assailing\n",
      "boats back to their ships, but to pursue the ship itself, and long\n",
      "withstand all the lances hurled at him from its decks. The English ship\n",
      "Pusie Hall can tell a story on that head; and, as for his strength,\n",
      "let me say, that there have been examples where the lines attached to a\n",
      "running sperm whale have, in a calm, been transferred to the ship, and\n",
      "secured there; the whale towing her great hull through the water, as a\n",
      "horse walks off with a cart. Again, it is very often observed that, if\n",
      "the sperm whale, once struck, is allowed time to rally, he then acts,\n",
      "not so often with blind rage, as with wilful, deliberate designs of\n",
      "destruction to his pursuers; nor is it without conveying some eloquent\n",
      "indication of his character, that upon being attacked he will frequently\n",
      "open his mouth, and retain it in that dread expansion for several\n",
      "consecutive minutes. But I must be content with only one more and a\n",
      "concluding illustration; a remarkable and most significant one, by which\n",
      "you will not fail to see, that not only is the most marvellous event in\n",
      "this book corroborated by plain facts of the present day, but that these\n",
      "marvels (like all marvels) are mere repetitions of the ages; so that for\n",

      "In the sixth Christian century lived Procopius, a Christian magistrate\n",

      "every way of uncommon value. By the best authorities, he has always been\n",

      "in the neighboring Propontis, or Sea of Marmora, after having destroyed\n",
      "vessels at intervals in those waters for a period of more than fifty\n",
      "years. A fact thus set down in substantial history cannot easily be\n",

      "this sea-monster was, is not mentioned. But as he destroyed ships, as\n",
      "well as for other reasons, he must have been a whale; and I am strongly\n",
      "inclined to think a sperm whale. And I will tell you why. For a long\n",
      "time I fancied that the sperm whale had been always unknown in the\n",
      "Mediterranean and the deep waters connecting with it. Even now I am\n",
      "certain that those seas are not, and perhaps never can be, in the\n",
      "present constitution of things, a place for his habitual gregarious\n",
      "resort. But further investigations have recently proved to me, that in\n",
      "modern times there have been isolated instances of the presence of the\n",
      "sperm whale in the Mediterranean. I am told, on good authority, that\n",
      "on the Barbary coast, a Commodore Davis of the British navy found\n",
      "the skeleton of a sperm whale. Now, as a vessel of war readily passes\n",
      "through the Dardanelles, hence a sperm whale could, by the same route,\n",
      "pass out of the Mediterranean into the Propontis.\n",
      "\n",
      "In the Propontis, as far as I can learn, none of that peculiar substance\n",
      "called BRIT is to be found, the aliment of the right whale. But I have\n",
      "every reason to believe that the food of the sperm whale--squid or\n",
      "cuttle-fish--lurks at the bottom of that sea, because large creatures,\n",
      "but by no means the largest of that sort, have been found at its\n",
      "surface. If, then, you properly put these statements together, and\n",
      "reason upon them a bit, you will clearly perceive that, according to all\n",
      "human reasoning, Procopius's sea-monster, that for half a century stove\n",

      "himself to the jerking tossings of his chip of a craft, and silently\n",

      "commander recklessly standing upon the top of the loggerhead, a stout\n",
      "sort of post rooted in the keel, and rising some two feet above the\n",
      "level of the stern platform. It is used for catching turns with the\n",
      "whale line. Its top is not more spacious than the palm of a man's hand,\n",

      "perched upon the loggerhead itself, under such circumstances. But the\n",
      "sight of little Flask mounted upon gigantic Daggoo was yet more curious;\n",
      "for sustaining himself with a cool, indifferent, easy, unthought of,\n",
      "barbaric majesty, the noble negro to every roll of the sea harmoniously\n",
      "rolled his fine form. On his broad back, flaxen-haired Flask seemed\n",
      "a snow-flake. The bearer looked nobler than the rider. Though truly\n",

      "stamp with impatience; but not one added heave did he thereby give to\n",
      "the negro's lordly chest. So have I seen Passion and Vanity stamping the\n",

      "Stubb, as his wont in such cases, it seems, was resolved to solace the\n",
      "languishing interval with his pipe. He withdrew it from his hatband,\n",
      "where he always wore it aslant like a feather. He loaded it, and rammed\n",

      "To a landsman, no whale, nor any sign of a herring, would have been\n",

      "water, and thin scattered puffs of vapour hovering over it, and\n",
      "suffusingly blowing off to leeward, like the confused scud from white\n",
      "rolling billows. The air around suddenly vibrated and tingled, as it\n",
      "were, like the air over intensely heated plates of iron. Beneath this\n",
      "atmospheric waving and curling, and partially beneath a thin layer of\n",
      "water, also, the whales were swimming. Seen in advance of all the other\n",
      "indications, the puffs of vapour they spouted, seemed their forerunning\n",
      "couriers and detached flying outriders.\n",
      "\n",
      "All four boats were now in keen pursuit of that one spot of troubled\n",
      "water and air. But it bade fair to outstrip them; it flew on and on,\n",
      "as a mass of interblending bubbles borne down a rapid stream from the\n",

      "\"Pull, pull, my good boys,\" said Starbuck, in the lowest possible but\n",

      "from his eyes darted straight ahead of the bow, almost seemed as two\n",
      "visible needles in two unerring binnacle compasses. He did not say much\n",
      "to his crew, though, nor did his crew say anything to him. Only the\n",
      "silence of the boat was at intervals startlingly pierced by one of his\n",
      "peculiar whispers, now harsh with command, now soft with entreaty.\n",

      "Lay me on--lay me on! O Lord, Lord! but I shall go stark, staring mad!\n",

      "head, and stamped up and down on it; then picking it up, flirted it far\n",

      "sociable contact. And especially would this seem to be a matter of\n",
      "course, in the case of vessels owned in one seaport, and whose captains,\n",

      "whalers; regarding the long, lean Nantucketer, with his nondescript\n",
      "provincialisms, as a sort of sea-peasant. But where this superiority\n",

      "So, then, we see that of all ships separately sailing the sea, the\n",
      "whalers have most reason to be sociable--and they are so. Whereas, some\n",
      "merchant ships crossing each other's wake in the mid-Atlantic, will\n",
      "oftentimes pass on without so much as a single word of recognition,\n",
      "mutually cutting each other on the high seas, like a brace of dandies in\n",

      "several of her company; especially by Radney the mate. He commanded\n",
      "the upper sails to be well hoisted, sheeted home anew, and every way\n",
      "expanded to the breeze. Now this Radney, I suppose, was as little of a\n",
      "coward, and as little inclined to any sort of nervous apprehensiveness\n",

      "on sea that you can conveniently imagine, gentlemen. Therefore when\n",
      "he betrayed this solicitude about the safety of the ship, some of the\n",
      "seamen declared that it was only on account of his being a part owner in\n",

      "with their feet continually overflowed by the rippling clear water;\n",
      "clear as any mountain spring, gentlemen--that bubbling from the pumps\n",

      "superior in general pride of manhood, straightway against that man he\n",

      "chance he will pull down and pulverize that subaltern's tower, and\n",
      "make a little heap of dust of it. Be this conceit of mine as it may,\n",
      "gentlemen, at all events Steelkilt was a tall and noble animal with a\n",
      "head like a Roman, and a flowing golden beard like the tasseled housings\n",
      "of your last viceroy's snorting charger; and a brain, and a heart, and\n",
      "a soul in him, gentlemen, which had made Steelkilt Charlemagne, had he\n",
      "been born son to Charlemagne's father. But Radney, the mate, was ugly\n",
      "as a mule; yet as hardy, as stubborn, as malicious. He did not love\n",

      "\n",
      "\"'Aye, aye, my merry lads, it's a lively leak this; hold a cannikin, one\n",
      "of ye, and let's have a taste. By the Lord, it's worth bottling! I tell\n",
      "ye what, men, old Rad's investment must go for it! he had best cut away\n",
      "his part of the hull and tow it home. The fact is, boys, that sword-fish\n",
      "only began the job; he's come back again with a gang of ship-carpenters,\n",
      "saw-fish, and file-fish, and what not; and the whole posse of 'em\n",
      "are now hard at work cutting and slashing at the bottom; making\n",
      "improvements, I suppose. If old Rad were here now, I'd tell him to jump\n",
      "overboard and scatter 'em. They're playing the devil with his estate, I\n",
      "can tell him. But he's a simple old soul,--Rad, and a beauty too. Boys,\n",
      "they say the rest of his property is invested in looking-glasses. I\n",
      "wonder if he'd give a poor devil like me the model of his nose.'\n",
      "\n",
      "\"'Damn your eyes! what's that pump stopping for?' roared Radney,\n",
      "pretending not to have heard the sailors' talk. 'Thunder away at it!'\n",
      "\n",
      "\"'Aye, aye, sir,' said Steelkilt, merry as a cricket. 'Lively, boys,\n",
      "lively, now!' And with that the pump clanged like fifty fire-engines;\n",
      "the men tossed their hats off to it, and ere long that peculiar gasping\n",
      "of the lungs was heard which denotes the fullest tension of life's\n",
      "utmost energies.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Quitting the pump at last, with the rest of his band, the Lakeman went\n",
      "forward all panting, and sat himself down on the windlass; his face\n",
      "fiery red, his eyes bloodshot, and wiping the profuse sweat from his\n",
      "brow. Now what cozening fiend it was, gentlemen, that possessed Radney\n",
      "to meddle with such a man in that corporeally exasperated state, I know\n",
      "not; but so it happened. Intolerably striding along the deck, the mate\n",
      "commanded him to get a broom and sweep down the planks, and also a\n",
      "shovel, and remove some offensive matters consequent upon allowing a pig\n",
      "to run at large.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Now, gentlemen, sweeping a ship's deck at sea is a piece of household\n",
      "work which in all times but raging gales is regularly attended to every\n",
      "evening; it has been known to be done in the case of ships actually\n",
      "foundering at the time. Such, gentlemen, is the inflexibility of\n",
      "sea-usages and the instinctive love of neatness in seamen; some of whom\n",
      "would not willingly drown without first washing their faces. But in all\n",
      "vessels this broom business is the prescriptive province of the boys,\n",
      "if boys there be aboard. Besides, it was the stronger men in the Town-Ho\n",
      "that had been divided into gangs, taking turns at the pumps; and being\n",
      "the most athletic seaman of them all, Steelkilt had been regularly\n",
      "assigned captain of one of the gangs; consequently he should have\n",
      "been freed from any trivial business not connected with truly nautical\n",
      "duties, such being the case with his comrades. I mention all these\n",
      "particulars so that you may understand exactly how this affair stood\n",
      "between the two men.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"But there was more than this: the order about the shovel was almost as\n",
      "plainly meant to sting and insult Steelkilt, as though Radney had spat\n",
      "in his face. Any man who has gone sailor in a whale-ship will\n",
      "understand this; and all this and doubtless much more, the Lakeman fully\n",
      "comprehended when the mate uttered his command. But as he sat still for\n",
      "a moment, and as he steadfastly looked into the mate's malignant eye and\n",
      "perceived the stacks of powder-casks heaped up in him and the slow-match\n",
      "silently burning along towards them; as he instinctively saw all\n",
      "this, that strange forbearance and unwillingness to stir up the deeper\n",
      "passionateness in any already ireful being--a repugnance most felt, when\n",
      "felt at all, by really valiant men even when aggrieved--this nameless\n",
      "phantom feeling, gentlemen, stole over Steelkilt.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Therefore, in his ordinary tone, only a little broken by the bodily\n",
      "exhaustion he was temporarily in, he answered him saying that sweeping\n",
      "the deck was not his business, and he would not do it. And then, without\n",
      "at all alluding to the shovel, he pointed to three lads as the customary\n",
      "sweepers; who, not being billeted at the pumps, had done little or\n",
      "nothing all day. To this, Radney replied with an oath, in a most\n",
      "domineering and outrageous manner unconditionally reiterating his\n",
      "command; meanwhile advancing upon the still seated Lakeman, with an\n",
      "uplifted cooper's club hammer which he had snatched from a cask near by.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Heated and irritated as he was by his spasmodic toil at the pumps, for\n",
      "all his first nameless feeling of forbearance the sweating Steelkilt\n",
      "could but ill brook this bearing in the mate; but somehow still\n",
      "smothering the conflagration within him, without speaking he remained\n",
      "doggedly rooted to his seat, till at last the incensed Radney shook the\n",
      "hammer within a few inches of his face, furiously commanding him to do\n",
      "his bidding.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Steelkilt rose, and slowly retreating round the windlass, steadily\n",
      "followed by the mate with his menacing hammer, deliberately repeated his\n",
      "intention not to obey. Seeing, however, that his forbearance had not\n",
      "the slightest effect, by an awful and unspeakable intimation with his\n",
      "twisted hand he warned off the foolish and infatuated man; but it was to\n",
      "no purpose. And in this way the two went once slowly round the windlass;\n",
      "when, resolved at last no longer to retreat, bethinking him that he had\n",
      "now forborne as much as comported with his humor, the Lakeman paused on\n",
      "the hatches and thus spoke to the officer:\n",
      "\n",
      "\"'Mr. Radney, I will not obey you. Take that hammer away, or look to\n",
      "yourself.' But the predestinated mate coming still closer to him, where\n",
      "the Lakeman stood fixed, now shook the heavy hammer within an inch of\n",
      "his teeth; meanwhile repeating a string of insufferable maledictions.\n",
      "Retreating not the thousandth part of an inch; stabbing him in the eye\n",
      "with the unflinching poniard of his glance, Steelkilt, clenching\n",
      "his right hand behind him and creepingly drawing it back, told his\n",
      "persecutor that if the hammer but grazed his cheek he (Steelkilt) would\n",
      "murder him. But, gentlemen, the fool had been branded for the slaughter\n",
      "by the gods. Immediately the hammer touched the cheek; the next instant\n",

      "spouting blood like a whale.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Ere the cry could go aft Steelkilt was shaking one of the backstays\n",

      "spite of her leak, and spite of all her other perils, the Town-Ho still\n",
      "maintained her mast-heads, and her captain was just as willing to\n",
      "lower for a fish that moment, as on the day his craft first struck the\n",
      "cruising ground; and Radney the mate was quite as ready to change his\n",

      "trick at the helm would come round at two o'clock, in the morning of the\n",
      "third day from that in which he had been betrayed. At his leisure,\n",

      "I shall ere long paint to you as well as one can without canvas,\n",
      "something like the true form of the whale as he actually appears to the\n",
      "eye of the whaleman when in his own absolute body the whale is moored\n",
      "alongside the whale-ship so that he can be fairly stepped upon there.\n",
      "It may be worth while, therefore, previously to advert to those\n",
      "curious imaginary portraits of him which even down to the present day\n",
      "confidently challenge the faith of the landsman. It is time to set the\n",
      "world right in this matter, by proving such pictures of the whale all\n",
      "wrong.\n",
      "\n",
      "It may be that the primal source of all those pictorial delusions will\n",
      "be found among the oldest Hindoo, Egyptian, and Grecian sculptures. For\n",
      "ever since those inventive but unscrupulous times when on the marble\n",
      "panellings of temples, the pedestals of statues, and on shields,\n",
      "medallions, cups, and coins, the dolphin was drawn in scales of\n",
      "chain-armor like Saladin's, and a helmeted head like St. George's; ever\n",
      "since then has something of the same sort of license prevailed, not\n",
      "only in most popular pictures of the whale, but in many scientific\n",
      "presentations of him.\n",
      "\n",
      "Now, by all odds, the most ancient extant portrait anyways purporting to\n",
      "be the whale's, is to be found in the famous cavern-pagoda of Elephanta,\n",
      "in India. The Brahmins maintain that in the almost endless sculptures of\n",
      "that immemorial pagoda, all the trades and pursuits, every conceivable\n",
      "avocation of man, were prefigured ages before any of them actually came\n",
      "into being. No wonder then, that in some sort our noble profession of\n",
      "whaling should have been there shadowed forth. The Hindoo whale\n",
      "referred to, occurs in a separate department of the wall, depicting the\n",
      "incarnation of Vishnu in the form of leviathan, learnedly known as the\n",
      "Matse Avatar. But though this sculpture is half man and half whale, so\n",
      "as only to give the tail of the latter, yet that small section of him is\n",
      "all wrong. It looks more like the tapering tail of an anaconda, than the\n",
      "broad palms of the true whale's majestic flukes.\n",
      "\n",
      "But go to the old Galleries, and look now at a great Christian painter's\n",
      "portrait of this fish; for he succeeds no better than the antediluvian\n",
      "Hindoo. It is Guido's picture of Perseus rescuing Andromeda from the\n",
      "sea-monster or whale. Where did Guido get the model of such a strange\n",
      "creature as that? Nor does Hogarth, in painting the same scene in his\n",
      "own \"Perseus Descending,\" make out one whit better. The huge corpulence\n",
      "of that Hogarthian monster undulates on the surface, scarcely drawing\n",
      "one inch of water. It has a sort of howdah on its back, and its\n",
      "distended tusked mouth into which the billows are rolling, might be\n",
      "taken for the Traitors' Gate leading from the Thames by water into the\n",
      "Tower. Then, there are the Prodromus whales of old Scotch Sibbald, and\n",
      "Jonah's whale, as depicted in the prints of old Bibles and the cuts of\n",
      "old primers. What shall be said of these? As for the book-binder's whale\n",
      "winding like a vine-stalk round the stock of a descending anchor--as\n",
      "stamped and gilded on the backs and title-pages of many books both\n",
      "old and new--that is a very picturesque but purely fabulous creature,\n",
      "imitated, I take it, from the like figures on antique vases.\n",
      "Though universally denominated a dolphin, I nevertheless call this\n",
      "book-binder's fish an attempt at a whale; because it was so intended\n",
      "when the device was first introduced. It was introduced by an old\n",
      "Italian publisher somewhere about the 15th century, during the Revival\n",
      "of Learning; and in those days, and even down to a comparatively\n",
      "late period, dolphins were popularly supposed to be a species of the\n",
      "Leviathan.\n",

      "In the vignettes and other embellishments of some ancient books you will\n",

      "of spouts, jets d'eau, hot springs and cold, Saratoga and Baden-Baden,\n",
      "come bubbling up from his unexhausted brain. In the title-page of the\n",

      "curious whales.\n",
      "\n",
      "But quitting all these unprofessional attempts, let us glance at those\n",
      "pictures of leviathan purporting to be sober, scientific delineations,\n",
      "by those who know. In old Harris's collection of voyages there are some\n",
      "plates of whales extracted from a Dutch book of voyages, A.D. 1671,\n",
      "entitled \"A Whaling Voyage to Spitzbergen in the ship Jonas in the\n",
      "Whale, Peter Peterson of Friesland, master.\" In one of those plates the\n",
      "whales, like great rafts of logs, are represented lying among ice-isles,\n",
      "with white bears running over their living backs. In another plate, the\n",
      "prodigious blunder is made of representing the whale with perpendicular\n",
      "flukes.\n",
      "\n",
      "Then again, there is an imposing quarto, written by one Captain Colnett,\n",
      "a Post Captain in the English navy, entitled \"A Voyage round Cape Horn\n",
      "into the South Seas, for the purpose of extending the Spermaceti Whale\n",
      "Fisheries.\" In this book is an outline purporting to be a \"Picture of\n",
      "a Physeter or Spermaceti whale, drawn by scale from one killed on the\n",
      "coast of Mexico, August, 1793, and hoisted on deck.\" I doubt not the\n",
      "captain had this veracious picture taken for the benefit of his marines.\n",
      "To mention but one thing about it, let me say that it has an eye which\n",
      "applied, according to the accompanying scale, to a full grown sperm\n",
      "whale, would make the eye of that whale a bow-window some five feet\n",
      "long. Ah, my gallant captain, why did ye not give us Jonah looking out\n",
      "of that eye!\n",
      "\n",
      "Nor are the most conscientious compilations of Natural History for\n",
      "the benefit of the young and tender, free from the same heinousness of\n",
      "mistake. Look at that popular work \"Goldsmith's Animated Nature.\" In the\n",
      "abridged London edition of 1807, there are plates of an alleged \"whale\"\n",
      "and a \"narwhale.\" I do not wish to seem inelegant, but this unsightly\n",
      "whale looks much like an amputated sow; and, as for the narwhale, one\n",
      "glimpse at it is enough to amaze one, that in this nineteenth century\n",
      "such a hippogriff could be palmed for genuine upon any intelligent\n",
      "public of schoolboys.\n",
      "\n",
      "Then, again, in 1825, Bernard Germain, Count de Lacepede, a great\n",
      "naturalist, published a scientific systemized whale book, wherein are\n",
      "several pictures of the different species of the Leviathan. All these\n",
      "are not only incorrect, but the picture of the Mysticetus or Greenland\n",
      "whale (that is to say, the Right whale), even Scoresby, a long\n",
      "experienced man as touching that species, declares not to have its\n",
      "counterpart in nature.\n",
      "\n",
      "But the placing of the cap-sheaf to all this blundering business was\n",
      "reserved for the scientific Frederick Cuvier, brother to the famous\n",
      "Baron. In 1836, he published a Natural History of Whales, in which he\n",
      "gives what he calls a picture of the Sperm Whale. Before showing that\n",
      "picture to any Nantucketer, you had best provide for your summary\n",
      "retreat from Nantucket. In a word, Frederick Cuvier's Sperm Whale is not\n",
      "a Sperm Whale, but a squash. Of course, he never had the benefit of\n",
      "a whaling voyage (such men seldom have), but whence he derived that\n",
      "picture, who can tell? Perhaps he got it as his scientific predecessor\n",
      "in the same field, Desmarest, got one of his authentic abortions; that\n",
      "is, from a Chinese drawing. And what sort of lively lads with the pencil\n",
      "those Chinese are, many queer cups and saucers inform us.\n",
      "\n",
      "As for the sign-painters' whales seen in the streets hanging over the\n",
      "shops of oil-dealers, what shall be said of them? They are generally\n",
      "Richard III. whales, with dromedary humps, and very savage; breakfasting\n",
      "on three or four sailor tarts, that is whaleboats full of mariners:\n",
      "their deformities floundering in seas of blood and blue paint.\n",
      "\n",
      "But these manifold mistakes in depicting the whale are not so very\n",
      "surprising after all. Consider! Most of the scientific drawings have\n",
      "been taken from the stranded fish; and these are about as correct as a\n",
      "drawing of a wrecked ship, with broken back, would correctly represent\n",
      "the noble animal itself in all its undashed pride of hull and spars.\n",
      "Though elephants have stood for their full-lengths, the living Leviathan\n",
      "has never yet fairly floated himself for his portrait. The living whale,\n",
      "in his full majesty and significance, is only to be seen at sea in\n",
      "unfathomable waters; and afloat the vast bulk of him is out of sight,\n",
      "like a launched line-of-battle ship; and out of that element it is a\n",
      "thing eternally impossible for mortal man to hoist him bodily into the\n",
      "air, so as to preserve all his mighty swells and undulations. And, not\n",
      "to speak of the highly presumable difference of contour between a young\n",
      "sucking whale and a full-grown Platonian Leviathan; yet, even in the\n",
      "case of one of those young sucking whales hoisted to a ship's deck, such\n",
      "is then the outlandish, eel-like, limbered, varying shape of him, that\n",
      "his precise expression the devil himself could not catch.\n",
      "\n",
      "But it may be fancied, that from the naked skeleton of the stranded\n",
      "whale, accurate hints may be derived touching his true form. Not at all.\n",
      "For it is one of the more curious things about this Leviathan, that\n",
      "his skeleton gives very little idea of his general shape. Though Jeremy\n",
      "Bentham's skeleton, which hangs for candelabra in the library of one of\n",
      "his executors, correctly conveys the idea of a burly-browed utilitarian\n",
      "old gentleman, with all Jeremy's other leading personal characteristics;\n",
      "yet nothing of this kind could be inferred from any leviathan's\n",
      "articulated bones. In fact, as the great Hunter says, the mere skeleton\n",
      "of the whale bears the same relation to the fully invested and padded\n",
      "animal as the insect does to the chrysalis that so roundingly envelopes\n",
      "it. This peculiarity is strikingly evinced in the head, as in some\n",
      "part of this book will be incidentally shown. It is also very curiously\n",
      "displayed in the side fin, the bones of which almost exactly answer to\n",
      "the bones of the human hand, minus only the thumb. This fin has four\n",
      "regular bone-fingers, the index, middle, ring, and little finger. But\n",
      "all these are permanently lodged in their fleshy covering, as the human\n",
      "fingers in an artificial covering. \"However recklessly the whale may\n",
      "sometimes serve us,\" said humorous Stubb one day, \"he can never be truly\n",
      "said to handle us without mittens.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "For all these reasons, then, any way you may look at it, you must needs\n",
      "conclude that the great Leviathan is that one creature in the world\n",
      "which must remain unpainted to the last. True, one portrait may hit\n",
      "the mark much nearer than another, but none can hit it with any very\n",
      "considerable degree of exactness. So there is no earthly way of finding\n",
      "out precisely what the whale really looks like. And the only mode in\n",
      "which you can derive even a tolerable idea of his living contour, is\n",
      "by going a whaling yourself; but by so doing, you run no small risk of\n",
      "being eternally stove and sunk by him. Wherefore, it seems to me you had\n",

      "\n",
      "The line originally used in the fishery was of the best hemp, slightly\n",
      "vapoured with tar, not impregnated with it, as in the case of ordinary\n",
      "ropes; for while tar, as ordinarily used, makes the hemp more pliable to\n",
      "the rope-maker, and also renders the rope itself more convenient to the\n",
      "sailor for common ship use; yet, not only would the ordinary quantity\n",
      "too much stiffen the whale-line for the close coiling to which it must\n",
      "be subjected; but as most seamen are beginning to learn, tar in general\n",
      "by no means adds to the rope's durability or strength, however much it\n",
      "may give it compactness and gloss.\n",
      "\n",
      "Of late years the Manilla rope has in the American fishery almost\n",
      "entirely superseded hemp as a material for whale-lines; for, though not\n",
      "so durable as hemp, it is stronger, and far more soft and elastic; and\n",
      "I will add (since there is an aesthetics in all things), is much more\n",
      "handsome and becoming to the boat, than hemp. Hemp is a dusky, dark\n",
      "fellow, a sort of Indian; but Manilla is as a golden-haired Circassian\n",
      "to behold.\n",
      "\n",
      "The whale-line is only two-thirds of an inch in thickness. At first\n",
      "sight, you would not think it so strong as it really is. By experiment\n",
      "its one and fifty yarns will each suspend a weight of one hundred and\n",
      "twenty pounds; so that the whole rope will bear a strain nearly equal\n",
      "to three tons. In length, the common sperm whale-line measures something\n",
      "over two hundred fathoms. Towards the stern of the boat it is spirally\n",
      "coiled away in the tub, not like the worm-pipe of a still though, but so\n",
      "as to form one round, cheese-shaped mass of densely bedded \"sheaves,\" or\n",
      "layers of concentric spiralizations, without any hollow but the \"heart,\"\n",
      "or minute vertical tube formed at the axis of the cheese. As the least\n",
      "tangle or kink in the coiling would, in running out, infallibly take\n",
      "somebody's arm, leg, or entire body off, the utmost precaution is used\n",

      "\n",
      "In the English boats two tubs are used instead of one; the same line\n",
      "being continuously coiled in both tubs. There is some advantage in this;\n",
      "because these twin-tubs being so small they fit more readily into the\n",
      "boat, and do not strain it so much; whereas, the American tub, nearly\n",
      "three feet in diameter and of proportionate depth, makes a rather bulky\n",
      "freight for a craft whose planks are but one half-inch in thickness; for\n",
      "the bottom of the whale-boat is like critical ice, which will bear up\n",
      "a considerable distributed weight, but not very much of a concentrated\n",
      "one. When the painted canvas cover is clapped on the American line-tub,\n",

      "Both ends of the line are exposed; the lower end terminating in an\n",
      "eye-splice or loop coming up from the bottom against the side of the\n",
      "tub, and hanging over its edge completely disengaged from everything.\n",
      "This arrangement of the lower end is necessary on two accounts. First:\n",
      "In order to facilitate the fastening to it of an additional line from a\n",
      "neighboring boat, in case the stricken whale should sound so deep as\n",
      "to threaten to carry off the entire line originally attached to the\n",
      "harpoon. In these instances, the whale of course is shifted like a mug\n",
      "of ale, as it were, from the one boat to the other; though the\n",
      "first boat always hovers at hand to assist its consort. Second: This\n",
      "arrangement is indispensable for common safety's sake; for were the\n",
      "lower end of the line in any way attached to the boat, and were the\n",
      "whale then to run the line out to the end almost in a single, smoking\n",
      "minute as he sometimes does, he would not stop there, for the doomed\n",
      "boat would infallibly be dragged down after him into the profundity of\n",
      "the sea; and in that case no town-crier would ever find her again.\n",
      "\n",
      "Before lowering the boat for the chase, the upper end of the line is\n",
      "taken aft from the tub, and passing round the loggerhead there, is again\n",
      "carried forward the entire length of the boat, resting crosswise upon\n",
      "the loom or handle of every man's oar, so that it jogs against his wrist\n",
      "in rowing; and also passing between the men, as they alternately sit at\n",
      "the opposite gunwales, to the leaded chocks or grooves in the extreme\n",
      "pointed prow of the boat, where a wooden pin or skewer the size of a\n",
      "common quill, prevents it from slipping out. From the chocks it hangs\n",
      "in a slight festoon over the bows, and is then passed inside the boat\n",
      "again; and some ten or twenty fathoms (called box-line) being coiled\n",
      "upon the box in the bows, it continues its way to the gunwale still a\n",
      "little further aft, and is then attached to the short-warp--the rope\n",
      "which is immediately connected with the harpoon; but previous to that\n",
      "connexion, the short-warp goes through sundry mystifications too tedious\n",

      "cannot habit accomplish?--Gayer sallies, more merry mirth, better jokes,\n",

      "a calm; so, forming a tandem of three boats, we commenced the slow\n",
      "business of towing the trophy to the Pequod. And now, as we eighteen men\n",
      "with our thirty-six arms, and one hundred and eighty thumbs and fingers,\n",
      "slowly toiled hour after hour upon that inert, sluggish corpse in the\n",
      "sea; and it seemed hardly to budge at all, except at long intervals;\n",
      "good evidence was hereby furnished of the enormousness of the mass we\n",
      "moved. For, upon the great canal of Hang-Ho, or whatever they call\n",

      "Darkness came on; but three lights up and down in the Pequod's\n",
      "main-rigging dimly guided our way; till drawing nearer we saw Ahab\n",
      "dropping one of several more lanterns over the bulwarks. Vacantly eyeing\n",

      "Though, in overseeing the pursuit of this whale, Captain Ahab had\n",

      "rattling out of the port-holes. But by those clanking links, the vast\n",
      "corpse itself, not the ship, is to be moored. Tied by the head to the\n",

      "is relatively heavier than any other (excepting the side-fins), its\n",

      "that with the hand you cannot get at it from the boat, in order to\n",
      "put the chain round it. But this difficulty is ingeniously overcome: a\n",
      "small, strong line is prepared with a wooden float at its outer end, and\n",
      "a weight in its middle, while the other end is secured to the ship. By\n",
      "adroit management the wooden float is made to rise on the other side\n",
      "of the mass, so that now having girdled the whale, the chain is readily\n",
      "made to follow suit; and being slipped along the body, is at last locked\n",

      "their backs as they scooped out huge globular pieces of the whale of the\n",

      "It is upon record, that three centuries ago the tongue of the Right\n",
      "Whale was esteemed a great delicacy in France, and commanded large\n",
      "prices there. Also, that in Henry VIIIth's time, a certain cook of the\n",
      "court obtained a handsome reward for inventing an admirable sauce to be\n",
      "eaten with barbacued porpoises, which, you remember, are a species of\n",
      "whale. Porpoises, indeed, are to this day considered fine eating. The\n",
      "meat is made into balls about the size of billiard balls, and being well\n",
      "seasoned and spiced might be taken for turtle-balls or veal balls.\n",
      "The old monks of Dunfermline were very fond of them. They had a great\n",

      "\n",
      "The fact is, that among his hunters at least, the whale would by all\n",
      "hands be considered a noble dish, were there not so much of him; but\n",
      "when you come to sit down before a meat-pie nearly one hundred feet\n",
      "long, it takes away your appetite. Only the most unprejudiced of men\n",
      "like Stubb, nowadays partake of cooked whales; but the Esquimaux are not\n",
      "so fastidious. We all know how they live upon whales, and have rare\n",
      "old vintages of prime old train oil. Zogranda, one of their most famous\n",
      "doctors, recommends strips of blubber for infants, as being exceedingly\n",
      "juicy and nourishing. And this reminds me that certain Englishmen, who\n",
      "long ago were accidentally left in Greenland by a whaling vessel--that\n",
      "these men actually lived for several months on the mouldy scraps of\n",
      "whales which had been left ashore after trying out the blubber. Among\n",
      "the Dutch whalemen these scraps are called \"fritters\"; which, indeed,\n",
      "they greatly resemble, being brown and crisp, and smelling something\n",
      "like old Amsterdam housewives' dough-nuts or oly-cooks, when fresh. They\n",
      "have such an eatable look that the most self-denying stranger can hardly\n",
      "keep his hands off.\n",
      "\n",
      "But what further depreciates the whale as a civilized dish, is his\n",

      "delicately good. Look at his hump, which would be as fine eating as\n",
      "the buffalo's (which is esteemed a rare dish), were it not such a solid\n",

      "is; like the transparent, half-jellied, white meat of a cocoanut in the\n",
      "third month of its growth, yet far too rich to supply a substitute for\n",
      "butter. Nevertheless, many whalemen have a method of absorbing it into\n",
      "some other substance, and then partaking of it. In the long try\n",
      "watches of the night it is a common thing for the seamen to dip their\n",

      "they are then mixed with flour, and cooked into a most delectable mess,\n",

      "of the seas were tumbling, not heaving it. Meantime, the hoisted sperm\n",
      "whale's head jogged about very violently, and Gabriel was seen eyeing\n",
      "it with rather more apprehensiveness than his archangel nature seemed to\n",
      "warrant.\n",
      "\n",
      "When this interlude was over, Captain Mayhew began a dark story\n",

      "leagued with him.\n",
      "\n",
      "It seemed that the Jeroboam had not long left home, when upon speaking\n",
      "a whale-ship, her people were reliably apprised of the existence of Moby\n",
      "Dick, and the havoc he had made. Greedily sucking in this intelligence,\n",
      "Gabriel solemnly warned the captain against attacking the White\n",
      "Whale, in case the monster should be seen; in his gibbering insanity,\n",
      "pronouncing the White Whale to be no less a being than the Shaker God\n",
      "incarnated; the Shakers receiving the Bible. But when, some year or two\n",
      "afterwards, Moby Dick was fairly sighted from the mast-heads, Macey, the\n",
      "chief mate, burned with ardour to encounter him; and the captain himself\n",
      "being not unwilling to let him have the opportunity, despite all\n",
      "the archangel's denunciations and forewarnings, Macey succeeded in\n",
      "persuading five men to man his boat. With them he pushed off; and, after\n",
      "much weary pulling, and many perilous, unsuccessful onsets, he at last\n",
      "succeeded in getting one iron fast. Meantime, Gabriel, ascending to\n",
      "the main-royal mast-head, was tossing one arm in frantic gestures, and\n",
      "hurling forth prophecies of speedy doom to the sacrilegious assailants\n",
      "of his divinity. Now, while Macey, the mate, was standing up in his\n",
      "boat's bow, and with all the reckless energy of his tribe was venting\n",
      "his wild exclamations upon the whale, and essaying to get a fair chance\n",
      "for his poised lance, lo! a broad white shadow rose from the sea; by its\n",
      "quick, fanning motion, temporarily taking the breath out of the bodies\n",
      "of the oarsmen. Next instant, the luckless mate, so full of furious\n",
      "life, was smitten bodily into the air, and making a long arc in his\n",
      "descent, fell into the sea at the distance of about fifty yards. Not a\n",
      "chip of the boat was harmed, nor a hair of any oarsman's head; but the\n",
      "mate for ever sank.\n",
      "\n",
      "It is well to parenthesize here, that of the fatal accidents in the\n",
      "Sperm-Whale Fishery, this kind is perhaps almost as frequent as any.\n",
      "Sometimes, nothing is injured but the man who is thus annihilated;\n",
      "oftener the boat's bow is knocked off, or the thigh-board, in which the\n",
      "headsman stands, is torn from its place and accompanies the body. But\n",
      "strangest of all is the circumstance, that in more instances than one,\n",
      "when the body has been recovered, not a single mark of violence is\n",
      "discernible; the man being stark dead.\n",
      "\n",
      "The whole calamity, with the falling form of Macey, was plainly descried\n",
      "from the ship. Raising a piercing shriek--\"The vial! the vial!\" Gabriel\n",
      "called off the terror-stricken crew from the further hunting of the\n",
      "whale. This terrible event clothed the archangel with added influence;\n",
      "because his credulous disciples believed that he had specifically\n",
      "fore-announced it, instead of only making a general prophecy, which any\n",
      "one might have done, and so have chanced to hit one of many marks in the\n",
      "wide margin allowed. He became a nameless terror to the ship.\n",
      "\n",
      "Mayhew having concluded his narration, Ahab put such questions to\n",
      "him, that the stranger captain could not forbear inquiring whether he\n",
      "intended to hunt the White Whale, if opportunity should offer. To which\n",
      "Ahab answered--\"Aye.\" Straightway, then, Gabriel once more started\n",
      "to his feet, glaring upon the old man, and vehemently exclaimed, with\n",
      "downward pointed finger--\"Think, think of the blasphemer--dead, and down\n",
      "there!--beware of the blasphemer's end!\"\n",
      "\n",
      "Ahab stolidly turned aside; then said to Mayhew, \"Captain, I have\n",

      "most letters never reach their mark; and many are only received after\n",
      "attaining an age of two or three years or more.\n",
      "\n",
      "Soon Starbuck returned with a letter in his hand. It was sorely tumbled,\n",
      "damp, and covered with a dull, spotted, green mould, in consequence\n",
      "of being kept in a dark locker of the cabin. Of such a letter, Death\n",
      "himself might well have been the post-boy.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Can'st not read it?\" cried Ahab. \"Give it me, man. Aye, aye, it's but\n",
      "a dim scrawl;--what's this?\" As he was studying it out, Starbuck took a\n",
      "long cutting-spade pole, and with his knife slightly split the end, to\n",
      "insert the letter there, and in that way, hand it to the boat, without\n",
      "its coming any closer to the ship.\n",
      "\n",
      "Meantime, Ahab holding the letter, muttered, \"Mr. Har--yes, Mr.\n",

      "caught it in the slit of the pole, and reached it over towards the boat.\n",

      "in an instant, seized the boat-knife, and impaling the letter on it,\n",
      "sent it thus loaded back into the ship. It fell at Ahab's feet. Then\n",

      "In the tumultuous business of cutting-in and attending to a whale, there\n",
      "is much running backwards and forwards among the crew. Now hands are\n",
      "wanted here, and then again hands are wanted there. There is no staying\n",
      "in any one place; for at one and the same time everything has to be done\n",
      "everywhere. It is much the same with him who endeavors the description\n",
      "of the scene. We must now retrace our way a little. It was mentioned\n",
      "that upon first breaking ground in the whale's back, the blubber-hook\n",
      "was inserted into the original hole there cut by the spades of the\n",
      "mates. But how did so clumsy and weighty a mass as that same hook\n",
      "get fixed in that hole? It was inserted there by my particular friend\n",
      "Queequeg, whose duty it was, as harpooneer, to descend upon the\n",
      "monster's back for the special purpose referred to. But in very many\n",
      "cases, circumstances require that the harpooneer shall remain on the\n",
      "whale till the whole flensing or stripping operation is concluded. The\n",
      "whale, be it observed, lies almost entirely submerged, excepting the\n",
      "immediate parts operated upon. So down there, some ten feet below the\n",
      "level of the deck, the poor harpooneer flounders about, half on the\n",
      "whale and half in the water, as the vast mass revolves like a tread-mill\n",
      "beneath him. On the occasion in question, Queequeg figured in the\n",
      "Highland costume--a shirt and socks--in which to my eyes, at least,\n",
      "he appeared to uncommon advantage; and no one had a better chance to\n",
      "observe him, as will presently be seen.\n",
      "\n",
      "Being the savage's bowsman, that is, the person who pulled the bow-oar\n",
      "in his boat (the second one from forward), it was my cheerful duty to\n",
      "attend upon him while taking that hard-scrabble scramble upon the dead\n",
      "whale's back. You have seen Italian organ-boys holding a dancing-ape by\n",
      "a long cord. Just so, from the ship's steep side, did I hold Queequeg\n",
      "down there in the sea, by what is technically called in the fishery\n",
      "a monkey-rope, attached to a strong strip of canvas belted round his\n",
      "waist.\n",
      "\n",
      "It was a humorously perilous business for both of us. For, before we\n",
      "proceed further, it must be said that the monkey-rope was fast at\n",
      "both ends; fast to Queequeg's broad canvas belt, and fast to my narrow\n",
      "leather one. So that for better or for worse, we two, for the time, were\n",
      "wedded; and should poor Queequeg sink to rise no more, then both usage\n",
      "and honour demanded, that instead of cutting the cord, it should drag\n",
      "me down in his wake. So, then, an elongated Siamese ligature united us.\n",
      "Queequeg was my own inseparable twin brother; nor could I any way get\n",
      "rid of the dangerous liabilities which the hempen bond entailed.\n",
      "\n",
      "So strongly and metaphysically did I conceive of my situation then, that\n",
      "while earnestly watching his motions, I seemed distinctly to perceive\n",
      "that my own individuality was now merged in a joint stock company of\n",
      "two; that my free will had received a mortal wound; and that another's\n",
      "mistake or misfortune might plunge innocent me into unmerited disaster\n",
      "and death. Therefore, I saw that here was a sort of interregnum in\n",

      "and then from between the whale and ship, which would threaten to jam\n",
      "him--still further pondering, I say, I saw that this situation of mine\n",
      "was the precise situation of every mortal that breathes; only, in most\n",
      "cases, he, one way or other, has this Siamese connexion with a plurality\n",
      "of other mortals. If your banker breaks, you snap; if your apothecary by\n",
      "mistake sends you poison in your pills, you die. True, you may say\n",
      "that, by exceeding caution, you may possibly escape these and the\n",
      "multitudinous other evil chances of life. But handle Queequeg's\n",
      "monkey-rope heedfully as I would, sometimes he jerked it so, that I came\n",
      "very near sliding overboard. Nor could I possibly forget that, do what I\n",

      "in order to afford the imperilled harpooneer the strongest possible\n",
      "guarantee for the faithfulness and vigilance of his monkey-rope holder.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "I have hinted that I would often jerk poor Queequeg from between the\n",
      "whale and the ship--where he would occasionally fall, from the incessant\n",
      "rolling and swaying of both. But this was not the only jamming jeopardy\n",
      "he was exposed to. Unappalled by the massacre made upon them during the\n",
      "night, the sharks now freshly and more keenly allured by the before pent\n",
      "blood which began to flow from the carcass--the rabid creatures swarmed\n",
      "round it like bees in a beehive.\n",
      "\n",
      "And right in among those sharks was Queequeg; who often pushed them\n",
      "aside with his floundering feet. A thing altogether incredible were\n",

      "miscellaneously carnivorous shark will seldom touch a man.\n",
      "\n",
      "Nevertheless, it may well be believed that since they have such a\n",

      "Accordingly, besides the monkey-rope, with which I now and then jerked\n",
      "the poor fellow from too close a vicinity to the maw of what seemed\n",
      "a peculiarly ferocious shark--he was provided with still another\n",
      "protection. Suspended over the side in one of the stages, Tashtego\n",
      "and Daggoo continually flourished over his head a couple of keen\n",
      "whale-spades, wherewith they slaughtered as many sharks as they could\n",
      "reach. This procedure of theirs, to be sure, was very disinterested and\n",
      "benevolent of them. They meant Queequeg's best happiness, I admit; but\n",
      "in their hasty zeal to befriend him, and from the circumstance that both\n",
      "he and the sharks were at times half hidden by the blood-muddled water,\n",
      "those indiscreet spades of theirs would come nearer amputating a leg\n",
      "than a tail. But poor Queequeg, I suppose, straining and gasping there\n",
      "with that great iron hook--poor Queequeg, I suppose, only prayed to his\n",
      "Yojo, and gave up his life into the hands of his gods.\n",
      "\n",
      "Well, well, my dear comrade and twin-brother, thought I, as I drew in\n",

      "up the chains and stands all dripping and involuntarily trembling over\n",
      "the side; the steward advances, and with a benevolent, consolatory\n",

      "astonished steward slowly saying, \"Ginger? ginger? and will you have\n",
      "the goodness to tell me, Mr. Dough-Boy, where lies the virtue of ginger?\n",
      "Ginger! is ginger the sort of fuel you use, Dough-boy, to kindle a fire\n",

      "if you please.\" Then watching the mate's countenance, he added, \"The\n",

      "to Queequeg, there, this instant off the whale. Is the steward an\n",

      "to know, will you obtain a better chance to study practical cetology\n",
      "than here?\n",
      "\n",
      "In the first place, you are struck by the general contrast between these\n",
      "heads. Both are massive enough in all conscience; but there is a certain\n",
      "mathematical symmetry in the Sperm Whale's which the Right Whale's sadly\n",
      "lacks. There is more character in the Sperm Whale's head. As you behold\n",
      "it, you involuntarily yield the immense superiority to him, in point\n",
      "of pervading dignity. In the present instance, too, this dignity is\n",
      "heightened by the pepper and salt colour of his head at the summit,\n",
      "giving token of advanced age and large experience. In short, he is what\n",
      "the fishermen technically call a \"grey-headed whale.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "Let us now note what is least dissimilar in these heads--namely, the two\n",
      "most important organs, the eye and the ear. Far back on the side of\n",
      "the head, and low down, near the angle of either whale's jaw, if you\n",
      "narrowly search, you will at last see a lashless eye, which you would\n",
      "fancy to be a young colt's eye; so out of all proportion is it to the\n",
      "magnitude of the head.\n",
      "\n",
      "Now, from this peculiar sideway position of the whale's eyes, it is\n",
      "plain that he can never see an object which is exactly ahead, no more\n",
      "than he can one exactly astern. In a word, the position of the whale's\n",
      "eyes corresponds to that of a man's ears; and you may fancy, for\n",
      "yourself, how it would fare with you, did you sideways survey objects\n",
      "through your ears. You would find that you could only command some\n",
      "thirty degrees of vision in advance of the straight side-line of sight;\n",
      "and about thirty more behind it. If your bitterest foe were walking\n",
      "straight towards you, with dagger uplifted in broad day, you would not\n",
      "be able to see him, any more than if he were stealing upon you from\n",
      "behind. In a word, you would have two backs, so to speak; but, at the\n",
      "same time, also, two fronts (side fronts): for what is it that makes the\n",
      "front of a man--what, indeed, but his eyes?\n",
      "\n",
      "Moreover, while in most other animals that I can now think of, the eyes\n",
      "are so planted as imperceptibly to blend their visual power, so as to\n",
      "produce one picture and not two to the brain; the peculiar position of\n",
      "the whale's eyes, effectually divided as they are by many cubic feet of\n",
      "solid head, which towers between them like a great mountain separating\n",
      "two lakes in valleys; this, of course, must wholly separate the\n",
      "impressions which each independent organ imparts. The whale, therefore,\n",
      "must see one distinct picture on this side, and another distinct\n",
      "picture on that side; while all between must be profound darkness and\n",
      "nothingness to him. Man may, in effect, be said to look out on the world\n",
      "from a sentry-box with two joined sashes for his window. But with the\n",
      "whale, these two sashes are separately inserted, making two distinct\n",
      "windows, but sadly impairing the view. This peculiarity of the whale's\n",
      "eyes is a thing always to be borne in mind in the fishery; and to be\n",
      "remembered by the reader in some subsequent scenes.\n",
      "\n",
      "A curious and most puzzling question might be started concerning this\n",
      "visual matter as touching the Leviathan. But I must be content with a\n",
      "hint. So long as a man's eyes are open in the light, the act of seeing\n",
      "is involuntary; that is, he cannot then help mechanically seeing\n",
      "whatever objects are before him. Nevertheless, any one's experience\n",
      "will teach him, that though he can take in an undiscriminating sweep of\n",
      "things at one glance, it is quite impossible for him, attentively,\n",
      "and completely, to examine any two things--however large or however\n",
      "small--at one and the same instant of time; never mind if they lie side\n",
      "by side and touch each other. But if you now come to separate these two\n",
      "objects, and surround each by a circle of profound darkness; then, in\n",
      "order to see one of them, in such a manner as to bring your mind to\n",
      "bear on it, the other will be utterly excluded from your contemporary\n",
      "consciousness. How is it, then, with the whale? True, both his eyes,\n",
      "in themselves, must simultaneously act; but is his brain so much more\n",
      "comprehensive, combining, and subtle than man's, that he can at the same\n",
      "moment of time attentively examine two distinct prospects, one on one\n",
      "side of him, and the other in an exactly opposite direction? If he\n",
      "can, then is it as marvellous a thing in him, as if a man were able\n",
      "simultaneously to go through the demonstrations of two distinct problems\n",
      "in Euclid. Nor, strictly investigated, is there any incongruity in this\n",

      "extraordinary vacillations of movement displayed by some whales when\n",
      "beset by three or four boats; the timidity and liability to queer\n",
      "frights, so common to such whales; I think that all this indirectly\n",
      "proceeds from the helpless perplexity of volition, in which their\n",
      "divided and diametrically opposite powers of vision must involve them.\n",

      "whatever; and into the hole itself you can hardly insert a quill, so\n",
      "wondrously minute is it. It is lodged a little behind the eye. With\n",
      "respect to their ears, this important difference is to be observed\n",
      "between the sperm whale and the right. While the ear of the former has\n",

      "Herschel's great telescope; and his ears capacious as the porches of\n",

      "German boats last lowered; but from the great start he had had, Derick's\n",
      "boat still led the chase, though every moment neared by his foreign\n",
      "rivals. The only thing they feared, was, that from being already so\n",
      "nigh to his mark, he would be enabled to dart his iron before they\n",

      "of retarding his rivals' way, and at the same time economically\n",
      "accelerating his own by the momentary impetus of the backward toss.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"The unmannerly Dutch dogger!\" cried Stubb. \"Pull now, men, like fifty\n",

      "momentarily neared him. In that fine, loose, chivalrous attitude of\n",
      "the headsman when drawing near to his prey, the three mates stood up\n",
      "proudly, occasionally backing the after oarsman with an exhilarating cry\n",
      "of, \"There she slides, now! Hurrah for the white-ash breeze! Down with\n",
      "the Yarman! Sail over him!\"\n",

      "But so decided an original start had Derick had, that spite of all\n",
      "their gallantry, he would have proved the victor in this race, had not\n",
      "a righteous judgment descended upon him in a crab which caught the blade\n",

      "capsizing, and he thundering away at his men in a mighty rage;--that was\n",

      "mortal start forwards, and slantingly ranged up on the German's quarter.\n",
      "An instant more, and all four boats were diagonically in the whale's\n",
      "immediate wake, while stretching from them, on both sides, was the\n",
      "foaming swell that he made.\n",
      "\n",
      "It was a terrific, most pitiable, and maddening sight. The whale was\n",
      "now going head out, and sending his spout before him in a continual\n",
      "tormented jet; while his one poor fin beat his side in an agony of\n",
      "fright. Now to this hand, now to that, he yawed in his faltering flight,\n",
      "and still at every billow that he broke, he spasmodically sank in the\n",
      "sea, or sideways rolled towards the sky his one beating fin. So have I\n",
      "seen a bird with clipped wing making affrighted broken circles in the\n",
      "air, vainly striving to escape the piratical hawks. But the bird has a\n",
      "voice, and with plaintive cries will make known her fear; but the fear\n",
      "of this vast dumb brute of the sea, was chained up and enchanted in him;\n",
      "he had no voice, save that choking respiration through his spiracle,\n",
      "and this made the sight of him unspeakably pitiable; while still, in his\n",
      "amazing bulk, portcullis jaw, and omnipotent tail, there was enough to\n",
      "appal the stoutest man who so pitied.\n",
      "\n",
      "Seeing now that but a very few moments more would give the Pequod's\n",
      "boats the advantage, and rather than be thus foiled of his game, Derick\n",
      "chose to hazard what to him must have seemed a most unusually long dart,\n",
      "ere the last chance would for ever escape.\n",
      "\n",
      "But no sooner did his harpooneer stand up for the stroke, than all three\n",
      "tigers--Queequeg, Tashtego, Daggoo--instinctively sprang to their feet,\n",
      "and standing in a diagonal row, simultaneously pointed their barbs; and\n",
      "darted over the head of the German harpooneer, their three Nantucket\n",
      "irons entered the whale. Blinding vapours of foam and white-fire! The\n",
      "three boats, in the first fury of the whale's headlong rush, bumped\n",
      "the German's aside with such force, that both Derick and his baffled\n",
      "harpooneer were spilled out, and sailed over by the three flying keels.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Don't be afraid, my butter-boxes,\" cried Stubb, casting a passing\n",
      "glance upon them as he shot by; \"ye'll be picked up presently--all\n",
      "right--I saw some sharks astern--St. Bernard's dogs, you know--relieve\n",
      "distressed travellers. Hurrah! this is the way to sail now. Every keel a\n",
      "sunbeam! Hurrah!--Here we go like three tin kettles at the tail of a mad\n",
      "cougar! This puts me in mind of fastening to an elephant in a tilbury on\n",

      "\n",
      "But the monster's run was a brief one. Giving a sudden gasp, he\n",
      "tumultuously sounded. With a grating rush, the three lines flew round\n",
      "the loggerheads with such a force as to gouge deep grooves in them;\n",
      "while so fearful were the harpooneers that this rapid sounding would\n",
      "soon exhaust the lines, that using all their dexterous might, they\n",
      "caught repeated smoking turns with the rope to hold on; till at\n",
      "last--owing to the perpendicular strain from the lead-lined chocks of\n",
      "the boats, whence the three ropes went straight down into the blue--the\n",
      "gunwales of the bows were almost even with the water, while the three\n",
      "sterns tilted high in the air. And the whale soon ceasing to sound,\n",
      "for some time they remained in that attitude, fearful of expending more\n",
      "line, though the position was a little ticklish. But though boats have\n",
      "been taken down and lost in this way, yet it is this \"holding on,\" as it\n",
      "is called; this hooking up by the sharp barbs of his live flesh from\n",
      "the back; this it is that often torments the Leviathan into soon rising\n",
      "again to meet the sharp lance of his foes. Yet not to speak of the peril\n",
      "of the thing, it is to be doubted whether this course is always the\n",
      "best; for it is but reasonable to presume, that the longer the stricken\n",
      "whale stays under water, the more he is exhausted. Because, owing to the\n",
      "enormous surface of him--in a full grown sperm whale something less than\n",
      "2000 square feet--the pressure of the water is immense. We all know\n",
      "what an astonishing atmospheric weight we ourselves stand up under; even\n",
      "here, above-ground, in the air; how vast, then, the burden of a whale,\n",
      "bearing on his back a column of two hundred fathoms of ocean! It must at\n",
      "least equal the weight of fifty atmospheres. One whaleman has estimated\n",
      "it at the weight of twenty line-of-battle ships, with all their guns,\n",
      "and stores, and men on board.\n",
      "\n",
      "As the three boats lay there on that gently rolling sea, gazing down\n",
      "into its eternal blue noon; and as not a single groan or cry of any\n",
      "sort, nay, not so much as a ripple or a bubble came up from its depths;\n",
      "what landsman would have thought, that beneath all that silence and\n",
      "placidity, the utmost monster of the seas was writhing and wrenching in\n",
      "agony! Not eight inches of perpendicular rope were visible at the bows.\n",
      "Seems it credible that by three such thin threads the great Leviathan\n",
      "was suspended like the big weight to an eight day clock. Suspended? and\n",
      "to what? To three bits of board. Is this the creature of whom it was\n",
      "once so triumphantly said--\"Canst thou fill his skin with barbed irons?\n",
      "or his head with fish-spears? The sword of him that layeth at him cannot\n",
      "hold, the spear, the dart, nor the habergeon: he esteemeth iron as\n",
      "straw; the arrow cannot make him flee; darts are counted as stubble;\n",
      "he laugheth at the shaking of a spear!\" This the creature? this he? Oh!\n",
      "that unfulfilments should follow the prophets. For with the strength\n",
      "of a thousand thighs in his tail, Leviathan had run his head under the\n",
      "mountains of the sea, to hide him from the Pequod's fish-spears!\n",
      "\n",
      "In that sloping afternoon sunlight, the shadows that the three boats\n",
      "sent down beneath the surface, must have been long enough and broad\n",
      "enough to shade half Xerxes' army. Who can tell how appalling to the\n",
      "wounded whale must have been such huge phantoms flitting over his head!\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Stand by, men; he stirs,\" cried Starbuck, as the three lines suddenly\n",
      "vibrated in the water, distinctly conducting upwards to them, as by\n",
      "magnetic wires, the life and death throbs of the whale, so that every\n",
      "oarsman felt them in his seat. The next moment, relieved in great part\n",
      "from the downward strain at the bows, the boats gave a sudden bounce\n",
      "upwards, as a small icefield will, when a dense herd of white bears are\n",
      "scared from it into the sea.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Haul in! Haul in!\" cried Starbuck again; \"he's rising.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "The lines, of which, hardly an instant before, not one hand's breadth\n",
      "could have been gained, were now in long quick coils flung back all\n",
      "dripping into the boats, and soon the whale broke water within two\n",
      "ship's lengths of the hunters.\n",
      "\n",
      "His motions plainly denoted his extreme exhaustion. In most land animals\n",
      "there are certain valves or flood-gates in many of their veins, whereby\n",
      "when wounded, the blood is in some degree at least instantly shut off in\n",
      "certain directions. Not so with the whale; one of whose peculiarities\n",
      "it is to have an entire non-valvular structure of the blood-vessels, so\n",
      "that when pierced even by so small a point as a harpoon, a deadly\n",
      "drain is at once begun upon his whole arterial system; and when this is\n",
      "heightened by the extraordinary pressure of water at a great distance\n",
      "below the surface, his life may be said to pour from him in incessant\n",
      "streams. Yet so vast is the quantity of blood in him, and so distant\n",
      "and numerous its interior fountains, that he will keep thus bleeding and\n",
      "bleeding for a considerable period; even as in a drought a river will\n",
      "flow, whose source is in the well-springs of far-off and undiscernible\n",
      "hills. Even now, when the boats pulled upon this whale, and perilously\n",
      "drew over his swaying flukes, and the lances were darted into him,\n",
      "they were followed by steady jets from the new made wound, which kept\n",
      "continually playing, while the natural spout-hole in his head was only\n",
      "at intervals, however rapid, sending its affrighted moisture into the\n",
      "air. From this last vent no blood yet came, because no vital part of him\n",
      "had thus far been struck. His life, as they significantly call it, was\n",
      "untouched.\n",
      "\n",
      "As the boats now more closely surrounded him, the whole upper part of\n",
      "his form, with much of it that is ordinarily submerged, was plainly\n",
      "revealed. His eyes, or rather the places where his eyes had been, were\n",
      "beheld. As strange misgrown masses gather in the knot-holes of the\n",
      "noblest oaks when prostrate, so from the points which the whale's eyes\n",
      "had once occupied, now protruded blind bulbs, horribly pitiable to see.\n",
      "But pity there was none. For all his old age, and his one arm, and his\n",
      "blind eyes, he must die the death and be murdered, in order to light the\n",
      "gay bridals and other merry-makings of men, and also to illuminate the\n",
      "solemn churches that preach unconditional inoffensiveness by all to all.\n",
      "Still rolling in his blood, at last he partially disclosed a strangely\n",
      "discoloured bunch or protuberance, the size of a bushel, low down on the\n",
      "flank.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"A nice spot,\" cried Flask; \"just let me prick him there once.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Avast!\" cried Starbuck, \"there's no need of that!\"\n",
      "\n",
      "But humane Starbuck was too late. At the instant of the dart an\n",
      "ulcerous jet shot from this cruel wound, and goaded by it into more than\n",
      "sufferable anguish, the whale now spouting thick blood, with swift fury\n",
      "blindly darted at the craft, bespattering them and their glorying crews\n",
      "all over with showers of gore, capsizing Flask's boat and marring the\n",
      "bows. It was his death stroke. For, by this time, so spent was he by\n",
      "loss of blood, that he helplessly rolled away from the wreck he had\n",
      "made; lay panting on his side, impotently flapped with his stumped fin,\n",
      "then over and over slowly revolved like a waning world; turned up\n",
      "the white secrets of his belly; lay like a log, and died. It was most\n",
      "piteous, that last expiring spout. As when by unseen hands the water\n",
      "is gradually drawn off from some mighty fountain, and with half-stifled\n",
      "melancholy gurglings the spray-column lowers and lowers to the\n",
      "ground--so the last long dying spout of the whale.\n",
      "\n",
      "Soon, while the crews were awaiting the arrival of the ship, the body\n",
      "showed symptoms of sinking with all its treasures unrifled. Immediately,\n",
      "by Starbuck's orders, lines were secured to it at different points, so\n",
      "that ere long every boat was a buoy; the sunken whale being suspended a\n",
      "few inches beneath them by the cords. By very heedful management, when\n",
      "the ship drew nigh, the whale was transferred to her side, and was\n",
      "strongly secured there by the stiffest fluke-chains, for it was plain\n",
      "that unless artificially upheld, the body would at once sink to the\n",
      "bottom.\n",
      "\n",
      "It so chanced that almost upon first cutting into him with the spade,\n",
      "the entire length of a corroded harpoon was found imbedded in his flesh,\n",
      "on the lower part of the bunch before described. But as the stumps of\n",
      "harpoons are frequently found in the dead bodies of captured whales,\n",
      "with the flesh perfectly healed around them, and no prominence of any\n",
      "kind to denote their place; therefore, there must needs have been\n",
      "some other unknown reason in the present case fully to account for\n",
      "the ulceration alluded to. But still more curious was the fact of a\n",
      "lance-head of stone being found in him, not far from the buried iron,\n",
      "the flesh perfectly firm about it. Who had darted that stone lance? And\n",
      "when? It might have been darted by some Nor' West Indian long before\n",
      "America was discovered.\n",
      "\n",
      "What other marvels might have been rummaged out of this monstrous\n",
      "cabinet there is no telling. But a sudden stop was put to further\n",
      "discoveries, by the ship's being unprecedentedly dragged over sideways\n",
      "to the sea, owing to the body's immensely increasing tendency to sink.\n",
      "However, Starbuck, who had the ordering of affairs, hung on to it to the\n",
      "last; hung on to it so resolutely, indeed, that when at length the ship\n",
      "would have been capsized, if still persisting in locking arms with the\n",
      "body; then, when the command was given to break clear from it, such was\n",
      "the immovable strain upon the timber-heads to which the fluke-chains and\n",
      "cables were fastened, that it was impossible to cast them off. Meantime\n",
      "everything in the Pequod was aslant. To cross to the other side of the\n",
      "deck was like walking up the steep gabled roof of a house. The ship\n",
      "groaned and gasped. Many of the ivory inlayings of her bulwarks and\n",
      "cabins were started from their places, by the unnatural dislocation.\n",
      "In vain handspikes and crows were brought to bear upon the immovable\n",
      "fluke-chains, to pry them adrift from the timberheads; and so low\n",
      "had the whale now settled that the submerged ends could not be at all\n",
      "approached, while every moment whole tons of ponderosity seemed added to\n",
      "the sinking bulk, and the ship seemed on the point of going over.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Hold on, hold on, won't ye?\" cried Stubb to the body, \"don't be in such\n",
      "a devil of a hurry to sink! By thunder, men, we must do something or go\n",
      "for it. No use prying there; avast, I say with your handspikes, and run\n",
      "one of ye for a prayer book and a pen-knife, and cut the big chains.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Knife? Aye, aye,\" cried Queequeg, and seizing the carpenter's heavy\n",
      "hatchet, he leaned out of a porthole, and steel to iron, began slashing\n",
      "at the largest fluke-chains. But a few strokes, full of sparks, were\n",
      "given, when the exceeding strain effected the rest. With a terrific\n",
      "snap, every fastening went adrift; the ship righted, the carcase sank.\n",
      "\n",
      "Now, this occasional inevitable sinking of the recently killed Sperm\n",
      "Whale is a very curious thing; nor has any fisherman yet adequately\n",
      "accounted for it. Usually the dead Sperm Whale floats with great\n",
      "buoyancy, with its side or belly considerably elevated above the\n",
      "surface. If the only whales that thus sank were old, meagre, and\n",
      "broken-hearted creatures, their pads of lard diminished and all their\n",
      "bones heavy and rheumatic; then you might with some reason assert that\n",
      "this sinking is caused by an uncommon specific gravity in the fish so\n",
      "sinking, consequent upon this absence of buoyant matter in him. But it\n",
      "is not so. For young whales, in the highest health, and swelling with\n",
      "noble aspirations, prematurely cut off in the warm flush and May of\n",
      "life, with all their panting lard about them; even these brawny, buoyant\n",
      "heroes do sometimes sink.\n",
      "\n",
      "Be it said, however, that the Sperm Whale is far less liable to this\n",
      "accident than any other species. Where one of that sort go down, twenty\n",
      "Right Whales do. This difference in the species is no doubt imputable in\n",
      "no small degree to the greater quantity of bone in the Right Whale;\n",
      "his Venetian blinds alone sometimes weighing more than a ton; from this\n",
      "incumbrance the Sperm Whale is wholly free. But there are instances\n",
      "where, after the lapse of many hours or several days, the sunken whale\n",
      "again rises, more buoyant than in life. But the reason of this\n",
      "is obvious. Gases are generated in him; he swells to a prodigious\n",
      "magnitude; becomes a sort of animal balloon. A line-of-battle ship could\n",
      "hardly keep him under then. In the Shore Whaling, on soundings, among\n",
      "the Bays of New Zealand, when a Right Whale gives token of sinking, they\n",
      "fasten buoys to him, with plenty of rope; so that when the body has gone\n",
      "down, they know where to look for it when it shall have ascended again.\n",
      "\n",
      "It was not long after the sinking of the body that a cry was heard from\n",
      "the Pequod's mast-heads, announcing that the Jungfrau was again lowering\n",
      "her boats; though the only spout in sight was that of a Fin-Back,\n",
      "belonging to the species of uncapturable whales, because of its\n",
      "incredible power of swimming. Nevertheless, the Fin-Back's spout is so\n",
      "similar to the Sperm Whale's, that by unskilful fishermen it is often\n",
      "mistaken for it. And consequently Derick and all his host were now in\n",
      "valiant chase of this unnearable brute. The Virgin crowding all sail,\n",
      "made after her four young keels, and thus they all disappeared far to\n",
      "leeward, still in bold, hopeful chase.\n",
      "\n",
      "Oh! many are the Fin-Backs, and many are the Dericks, my friend.\n",

      "Reference was made to the historical story of Jonah and the whale in the\n",
      "preceding chapter. Now some Nantucketers rather distrust this historical\n",
      "story of Jonah and the whale. But then there were some sceptical Greeks\n",
      "and Romans, who, standing out from the orthodox pagans of their times,\n",
      "equally doubted the story of Hercules and the whale, and Arion and the\n",
      "dolphin; and yet their doubting those traditions did not make those\n",
      "traditions one whit the less facts, for all that.\n",
      "\n",
      "One old Sag-Harbor whaleman's chief reason for questioning the Hebrew\n",
      "story was this:--He had one of those quaint old-fashioned Bibles,\n",
      "embellished with curious, unscientific plates; one of which represented\n",
      "Jonah's whale with two spouts in his head--a peculiarity only true\n",
      "with respect to a species of the Leviathan (the Right Whale, and the\n",
      "varieties of that order), concerning which the fishermen have this\n",
      "saying, \"A penny roll would choke him\"; his swallow is so very small.\n",
      "But, to this, Bishop Jebb's anticipative answer is ready. It is not\n",
      "necessary, hints the Bishop, that we consider Jonah as tombed in the\n",
      "whale's belly, but as temporarily lodged in some part of his mouth. And\n",
      "this seems reasonable enough in the good Bishop. For truly, the\n",
      "Right Whale's mouth would accommodate a couple of whist-tables, and\n",
      "comfortably seat all the players. Possibly, too, Jonah might have\n",
      "ensconced himself in a hollow tooth; but, on second thoughts, the Right\n",
      "Whale is toothless.\n",
      "\n",
      "Another reason which Sag-Harbor (he went by that name) urged for his\n",
      "want of faith in this matter of the prophet, was something obscurely in\n",
      "reference to his incarcerated body and the whale's gastric juices. But\n",
      "this objection likewise falls to the ground, because a German exegetist\n",
      "supposes that Jonah must have taken refuge in the floating body of a\n",
      "DEAD whale--even as the French soldiers in the Russian campaign turned\n",
      "their dead horses into tents, and crawled into them. Besides, it has\n",
      "been divined by other continental commentators, that when Jonah was\n",
      "thrown overboard from the Joppa ship, he straightway effected his escape\n",
      "to another vessel near by, some vessel with a whale for a figure-head;\n",
      "and, I would add, possibly called \"The Whale,\" as some craft are\n",
      "nowadays christened the \"Shark,\" the \"Gull,\" the \"Eagle.\" Nor have there\n",
      "been wanting learned exegetists who have opined that the whale mentioned\n",
      "in the book of Jonah merely meant a life-preserver--an inflated bag\n",
      "of wind--which the endangered prophet swam to, and so was saved from a\n",
      "watery doom. Poor Sag-Harbor, therefore, seems worsted all round. But\n",
      "he had still another reason for his want of faith. It was this, if I\n",
      "remember right: Jonah was swallowed by the whale in the Mediterranean\n",
      "Sea, and after three days he was vomited up somewhere within three days'\n",
      "journey of Nineveh, a city on the Tigris, very much more than three\n",
      "days' journey across from the nearest point of the Mediterranean coast.\n",
      "How is that?\n",
      "\n",
      "But was there no other way for the whale to land the prophet within that\n",
      "short distance of Nineveh? Yes. He might have carried him round by the\n",
      "way of the Cape of Good Hope. But not to speak of the passage through\n",
      "the whole length of the Mediterranean, and another passage up the\n",
      "Persian Gulf and Red Sea, such a supposition would involve the complete\n",
      "circumnavigation of all Africa in three days, not to speak of the Tigris\n",
      "waters, near the site of Nineveh, being too shallow for any whale to\n",
      "swim in. Besides, this idea of Jonah's weathering the Cape of Good Hope\n",

      "headland from Bartholomew Diaz, its reputed discoverer, and so make\n",
      "modern history a liar.\n",

      "But all these foolish arguments of old Sag-Harbor only evinced his\n",

      "that he had but little learning except what he had picked up from the\n",
      "sun and the sea. I say it only shows his foolish, impious pride, and\n",

      "furious. What then remained?\n",

      "Of all the wondrous devices and dexterities, the sleights of hand and\n",

      "sword, or broad sword, in all its exercises boasts nothing like it. It\n",
      "is only indispensable with an inveterate running whale; its grand\n",
      "fact and feature is the wonderful distance to which the long lance is\n",
      "accurately darted from a violently rocking, jerking boat, under extreme\n",
      "headway. Steel and wood included, the entire spear is some ten or twelve\n",
      "feet in length; the staff is much slighter than that of the harpoon,\n",

      "the harpoon may be pitchpoled in the same way with the lance, yet it\n",
      "is seldom done; and when done, is still less frequently successful,\n",
      "on account of the greater weight and inferior length of the harpoon as\n",
      "compared with the lance, which in effect become serious drawbacks. As a\n",
      "general thing, therefore, you must first get fast to a whale, before any\n",
      "pitchpoling comes into play.\n",
      "\n",
      "Look now at Stubb; a man who from his humorous, deliberate coolness and\n",
      "equanimity in the direst emergencies, was specially qualified to excel\n",
      "in pitchpoling. Look at him; he stands upright in the tossed bow of the\n",
      "flying boat; wrapt in fleecy foam, the towing whale is forty feet ahead.\n",
      "Handling the long lance lightly, glancing twice or thrice along its\n",
      "length to see if it be exactly straight, Stubb whistlingly gathers up\n",
      "the coil of the warp in one hand, so as to secure its free end in his\n",
      "grasp, leaving the rest unobstructed. Then holding the lance full before\n",
      "his waistband's middle, he levels it at the whale; when, covering\n",
      "him with it, he steadily depresses the butt-end in his hand, thereby\n",
      "elevating the point till the weapon stands fairly balanced upon his\n",
      "palm, fifteen feet in the air. He minds you somewhat of a juggler,\n",

      "impulse, in a superb lofty arch the bright steel spans the foaming\n",

      "before--the great whales should have been spouting all over the sea,\n",

      "\n",
      "Let us, then, look at this matter, along with some interesting items\n",
      "contingent. Every one knows that by the peculiar cunning of their\n",
      "gills, the finny tribes in general breathe the air which at all times is\n",
      "combined with the element in which they swim; hence, a herring or a cod\n",
      "might live a century, and never once raise its head above the surface.\n",
      "But owing to his marked internal structure which gives him regular\n",
      "lungs, like a human being's, the whale can only live by inhaling the\n",
      "disengaged air in the open atmosphere. Wherefore the necessity for\n",
      "his periodical visits to the upper world. But he cannot in any degree\n",
      "breathe through his mouth, for, in his ordinary attitude, the Sperm\n",
      "Whale's mouth is buried at least eight feet beneath the surface; and\n",
      "what is still more, his windpipe has no connexion with his mouth. No, he\n",
      "breathes through his spiracle alone; and this is on the top of his head.\n",
      "\n",
      "If I say, that in any creature breathing is only a function\n",
      "indispensable to vitality, inasmuch as it withdraws from the air a\n",
      "certain element, which being subsequently brought into contact with the\n",
      "blood imparts to the blood its vivifying principle, I do not think I\n",
      "shall err; though I may possibly use some superfluous scientific words.\n",
      "Assume it, and it follows that if all the blood in a man could be\n",
      "aerated with one breath, he might then seal up his nostrils and not\n",
      "fetch another for a considerable time. That is to say, he would then\n",
      "live without breathing. Anomalous as it may seem, this is precisely the\n",
      "case with the whale, who systematically lives, by intervals, his full\n",
      "hour and more (when at the bottom) without drawing a single breath, or\n",
      "so much as in any way inhaling a particle of air; for, remember, he has\n",
      "no gills. How is this? Between his ribs and on each side of his spine\n",
      "he is supplied with a remarkable involved Cretan labyrinth of\n",
      "vermicelli-like vessels, which vessels, when he quits the surface, are\n",
      "completely distended with oxygenated blood. So that for an hour or more,\n",
      "a thousand fathoms in the sea, he carries a surplus stock of vitality in\n",
      "him, just as the camel crossing the waterless desert carries a surplus\n",
      "supply of drink for future use in its four supplementary stomachs.\n",
      "The anatomical fact of this labyrinth is indisputable; and that the\n",
      "supposition founded upon it is reasonable and true, seems the more\n",
      "cogent to me, when I consider the otherwise inexplicable obstinacy of\n",
      "that leviathan in HAVING HIS SPOUTINGS OUT, as the fishermen phrase\n",
      "it. This is what I mean. If unmolested, upon rising to the surface, the\n",
      "Sperm Whale will continue there for a period of time exactly uniform\n",
      "with all his other unmolested risings. Say he stays eleven minutes, and\n",
      "jets seventy times, that is, respires seventy breaths; then whenever he\n",
      "rises again, he will be sure to have his seventy breaths over again, to\n",
      "a minute. Now, if after he fetches a few breaths you alarm him, so that\n",
      "he sounds, he will be always dodging up again to make good his regular\n",
      "allowance of air. And not till those seventy breaths are told, will he\n",
      "finally go down to stay out his full term below. Remark, however, that\n",
      "in different individuals these rates are different; but in any one\n",
      "they are alike. Now, why should the whale thus insist upon having his\n",
      "spoutings out, unless it be to replenish his reservoir of air, ere\n",
      "descending for good? How obvious is it, too, that this necessity for the\n",
      "whale's rising exposes him to all the fatal hazards of the chase. For\n",
      "not by hook or by net could this vast leviathan be caught, when sailing\n",

      "I opine we should be furnished with the reason why his sense of smell\n",
      "seems obliterated in him; for the only thing about him that at all\n",
      "answers to his nose is that identical spout-hole; and being so clogged\n",
      "with two elements, it could not be expected to have the power of\n",
      "smelling. But owing to the mystery of the spout--whether it be water or\n",
      "whether it be vapour--no absolute certainty can as yet be arrived at on\n",
      "this head. Sure it is, nevertheless, that the Sperm Whale has no proper\n",

      "with a sort of locks (that open and shut) for the downward retention of\n",
      "air or the upward exclusion of water, therefore the whale has no voice;\n",
      "unless you insult him by saying, that when he so strangely rumbles,\n",
      "he talks through his nose. But then again, what has the whale to say?\n",

      "Now, the spouting canal of the Sperm Whale, chiefly intended as it\n",
      "is for the conveyance of air, and for several feet laid along,\n",
      "horizontally, just beneath the upper surface of his head, and a little\n",
      "to one side; this curious canal is very much like a gas-pipe laid down\n",
      "in a city on one side of a street. But the question returns whether this\n",
      "gas-pipe is also a water-pipe; in other words, whether the spout of the\n",
      "Sperm Whale is the mere vapour of the exhaled breath, or whether that\n",
      "exhaled breath is mixed with water taken in at the mouth, and\n",
      "discharged through the spiracle. It is certain that the mouth indirectly\n",
      "communicates with the spouting canal; but it cannot be proved that this\n",
      "is for the purpose of discharging water through the spiracle. Because\n",
      "the greatest necessity for so doing would seem to be, when in feeding he\n",
      "accidentally takes in water. But the Sperm Whale's food is far beneath\n",
      "the surface, and there he cannot spout even if he would. Besides, if\n",
      "you regard him very closely, and time him with your watch, you will find\n",
      "that when unmolested, there is an undeviating rhyme between the periods\n",
      "of his jets and the ordinary periods of respiration.\n",
      "\n",
      "But why pester one with all this reasoning on the subject? Speak out!\n",
      "You have seen him spout; then declare what the spout is; can you not\n",
      "tell water from air? My dear sir, in this world it is not so easy to\n",
      "settle these plain things. I have ever found your plain things the\n",
      "knottiest of all. And as for this whale spout, you might almost stand in\n",
      "it, and yet be undecided as to what it is precisely.\n",
      "\n",
      "The central body of it is hidden in the snowy sparkling mist enveloping\n",
      "it; and how can you certainly tell whether any water falls from it,\n",
      "when, always, when you are close enough to a whale to get a close view\n",
      "of his spout, he is in a prodigious commotion, the water cascading\n",
      "all around him. And if at such times you should think that you really\n",
      "perceived drops of moisture in the spout, how do you know that they are\n",
      "not merely condensed from its vapour; or how do you know that they\n",
      "are not those identical drops superficially lodged in the spout-hole\n",
      "fissure, which is countersunk into the summit of the whale's head? For\n",
      "even when tranquilly swimming through the mid-day sea in a calm, with\n",
      "his elevated hump sun-dried as a dromedary's in the desert; even then,\n",
      "the whale always carries a small basin of water on his head, as under\n",
      "a blazing sun you will sometimes see a cavity in a rock filled up with\n",
      "rain.\n",
      "\n",
      "Nor is it at all prudent for the hunter to be over curious touching the\n",
      "precise nature of the whale spout. It will not do for him to be peering\n",
      "into it, and putting his face in it. You cannot go with your pitcher to\n",
      "this fountain and fill it, and bring it away. For even when coming into\n",
      "slight contact with the outer, vapoury shreds of the jet, which will\n",
      "often happen, your skin will feverishly smart, from the acridness of\n",
      "the thing so touching it. And I know one, who coming into still closer\n",
      "contact with the spout, whether with some scientific object in view,\n",
      "or otherwise, I cannot say, the skin peeled off from his cheek and arm.\n",
      "Wherefore, among whalemen, the spout is deemed poisonous; they try to\n",

      "it, that if the jet is fairly spouted into your eyes, it will blind you.\n",
      "The wisest thing the investigator can do then, it seems to me, is to let\n",
      "this deadly spout alone.\n",
      "\n",
      "Still, we can hypothesize, even if we cannot prove and establish. My\n",
      "hypothesis is this: that the spout is nothing but mist. And besides\n",
      "other reasons, to this conclusion I am impelled, by considerations\n",
      "touching the great inherent dignity and sublimity of the Sperm Whale;\n",
      "I account him no common, shallow being, inasmuch as it is an undisputed\n",
      "fact that he is never found on soundings, or near shores; all other\n",
      "whales sometimes are. He is both ponderous and profound. And I am\n",
      "convinced that from the heads of all ponderous profound beings, such as\n",
      "Plato, Pyrrho, the Devil, Jupiter, Dante, and so on, there always goes\n",
      "up a certain semi-visible steam, while in the act of thinking deep\n",

      "curiosity to place a mirror before me; and ere long saw reflected there,\n",

      "after six cups of hot tea in my thin shingled attic, of an August noon;\n",
      "this seems an additional argument for the above supposition.\n",
      "\n",
      "And how nobly it raises our conceit of the mighty, misty monster, to\n",
      "behold him solemnly sailing through a calm tropical sea; his vast, mild\n",
      "head overhung by a canopy of vapour, engendered by his incommunicable\n",
      "contemplations, and that vapour--as you will sometimes see it--glorified\n",

      "\n",
      "\n",
      "Other poets have warbled the praises of the soft eye of the antelope,\n",
      "and the lovely plumage of the bird that never alights; less celestial, I\n",
      "celebrate a tail.\n",
      "\n",
      "Reckoning the largest sized Sperm Whale's tail to begin at that point of\n",
      "the trunk where it tapers to about the girth of a man, it comprises\n",
      "upon its upper surface alone, an area of at least fifty square feet. The\n",
      "compact round body of its root expands into two broad, firm, flat palms\n",
      "or flukes, gradually shoaling away to less than an inch in thickness.\n",
      "At the crotch or junction, these flukes slightly overlap, then sideways\n",
      "recede from each other like wings, leaving a wide vacancy between. In\n",
      "no living thing are the lines of beauty more exquisitely defined than in\n",
      "the crescentic borders of these flukes. At its utmost expansion in the\n",
      "full grown whale, the tail will considerably exceed twenty feet across.\n",
      "\n",
      "The entire member seems a dense webbed bed of welded sinews; but cut\n",
      "into it, and you find that three distinct strata compose it:--upper,\n",
      "middle, and lower. The fibres in the upper and lower layers, are\n",
      "long and horizontal; those of the middle one, very short, and running\n",
      "crosswise between the outside layers. This triune structure, as much as\n",
      "anything else, imparts power to the tail. To the student of old Roman\n",
      "walls, the middle layer will furnish a curious parallel to the thin\n",
      "course of tiles always alternating with the stone in those wonderful\n",
      "relics of the antique, and which undoubtedly contribute so much to the\n",
      "great strength of the masonry.\n",
      "\n",
      "But as if this vast local power in the tendinous tail were not enough,\n",
      "the whole bulk of the leviathan is knit over with a warp and woof of\n",
      "muscular fibres and filaments, which passing on either side the loins\n",
      "and running down into the flukes, insensibly blend with them, and\n",
      "largely contribute to their might; so that in the tail the confluent\n",
      "measureless force of the whole whale seems concentrated to a point.\n",
      "Could annihilation occur to matter, this were the thing to do it.\n",
      "\n",
      "Nor does this--its amazing strength, at all tend to cripple the graceful\n",
      "flexion of its motions; where infantileness of ease undulates through\n",
      "a Titanism of power. On the contrary, those motions derive their most\n",
      "appalling beauty from it. Real strength never impairs beauty or harmony,\n",
      "but it often bestows it; and in everything imposingly beautiful,\n",
      "strength has much to do with the magic. Take away the tied tendons that\n",

      "charm would be gone. As devout Eckerman lifted the linen sheet from the\n",
      "naked corpse of Goethe, he was overwhelmed with the massive chest of the\n",
      "man, that seemed as a Roman triumphal arch. When Angelo paints even God\n",

      "Such is the subtle elasticity of the organ I treat of, that whether\n",
      "wielded in sport, or in earnest, or in anger, whatever be the mood it\n",
      "be in, its flexions are invariably marked by exceeding grace. Therein no\n",
      "fairy's arm can transcend it.\n",
      "\n",
      "Five great motions are peculiar to it. First, when used as a fin for\n",
      "progression; Second, when used as a mace in battle; Third, in sweeping;\n",
      "Fourth, in lobtailing; Fifth, in peaking flukes.\n",
      "\n",
      "First: Being horizontal in its position, the Leviathan's tail acts in\n",
      "a different manner from the tails of all other sea creatures. It never\n",
      "wriggles. In man or fish, wriggling is a sign of inferiority. To the\n",
      "whale, his tail is the sole means of propulsion. Scroll-wise coiled\n",
      "forwards beneath the body, and then rapidly sprung backwards, it is this\n",
      "which gives that singular darting, leaping motion to the monster when\n",
      "furiously swimming. His side-fins only serve to steer by.\n",
      "\n",
      "Second: It is a little significant, that while one sperm whale only\n",
      "fights another sperm whale with his head and jaw, nevertheless, in his\n",
      "conflicts with man, he chiefly and contemptuously uses his tail. In\n",
      "striking at a boat, he swiftly curves away his flukes from it, and the\n",
      "blow is only inflicted by the recoil. If it be made in the unobstructed\n",
      "air, especially if it descend to its mark, the stroke is then simply\n",
      "irresistible. No ribs of man or boat can withstand it. Your only\n",
      "salvation lies in eluding it; but if it comes sideways through the\n",
      "opposing water, then partly owing to the light buoyancy of the whale\n",
      "boat, and the elasticity of its materials, a cracked rib or a dashed\n",
      "plank or two, a sort of stitch in the side, is generally the most\n",
      "serious result. These submerged side blows are so often received in the\n",
      "fishery, that they are accounted mere child's play. Some one strips off\n",
      "a frock, and the hole is stopped.\n",
      "\n",
      "Third: I cannot demonstrate it, but it seems to me, that in the whale\n",
      "the sense of touch is concentrated in the tail; for in this respect\n",
      "there is a delicacy in it only equalled by the daintiness of the\n",
      "elephant's trunk. This delicacy is chiefly evinced in the action of\n",
      "sweeping, when in maidenly gentleness the whale with a certain soft\n",
      "slowness moves his immense flukes from side to side upon the surface\n",
      "of the sea; and if he feel but a sailor's whisker, woe to that sailor,\n",
      "whiskers and all. What tenderness there is in that preliminary touch!\n",
      "Had this tail any prehensile power, I should straightway bethink me of\n",
      "Darmonodes' elephant that so frequented the flower-market, and with\n",
      "low salutations presented nosegays to damsels, and then caressed their\n",
      "zones. On more accounts than one, a pity it is that the whale does not\n",
      "possess this prehensile virtue in his tail; for I have heard of yet\n",
      "another elephant, that when wounded in the fight, curved round his trunk\n",
      "and extracted the dart.\n",
      "\n",
      "Fourth: Stealing unawares upon the whale in the fancied security of the\n",
      "middle of solitary seas, you find him unbent from the vast corpulence\n",
      "of his dignity, and kitten-like, he plays on the ocean as if it were a\n",
      "hearth. But still you see his power in his play. The broad palms of\n",
      "his tail are flirted high into the air; then smiting the surface, the\n",
      "thunderous concussion resounds for miles. You would almost think a great\n",
      "gun had been discharged; and if you noticed the light wreath of vapour\n",
      "from the spiracle at his other extremity, you would think that that was\n",
      "the smoke from the touch-hole.\n",
      "\n",
      "Fifth: As in the ordinary floating posture of the leviathan the flukes\n",
      "lie considerably below the level of his back, they are then completely\n",
      "out of sight beneath the surface; but when he is about to plunge into\n",
      "the deeps, his entire flukes with at least thirty feet of his body are\n",
      "tossed erect in the air, and so remain vibrating a moment, till they\n",
      "downwards shoot out of view. Excepting the sublime BREACH--somewhere\n",
      "else to be described--this peaking of the whale's flukes is perhaps the\n",
      "grandest sight to be seen in all animated nature. Out of the bottomless\n",
      "profundities the gigantic tail seems spasmodically snatching at the\n",
      "highest heaven. So in dreams, have I seen majestic Satan thrusting forth\n",
      "his tormented colossal claw from the flame Baltic of Hell. But in\n",
      "gazing at such scenes, it is all in all what mood you are in; if in\n",
      "the Dantean, the devils will occur to you; if in that of Isaiah, the\n",
      "archangels. Standing at the mast-head of my ship during a sunrise that\n",
      "crimsoned sky and sea, I once saw a large herd of whales in the east,\n",
      "all heading towards the sun, and for a moment vibrating in concert with\n",
      "peaked flukes. As it seemed to me at the time, such a grand embodiment\n",
      "of adoration of the gods was never beheld, even in Persia, the home of\n",
      "the fire worshippers. As Ptolemy Philopater testified of the African\n",
      "elephant, I then testified of the whale, pronouncing him the most devout\n",
      "of all beings. For according to King Juba, the military elephants of\n",
      "antiquity often hailed the morning with their trunks uplifted in the\n",
      "profoundest silence.\n",
      "\n",
      "The chance comparison in this chapter, between the whale and the\n",
      "elephant, so far as some aspects of the tail of the one and the trunk\n",
      "of the other are concerned, should not tend to place those two\n",
      "opposite organs on an equality, much less the creatures to which they\n",
      "respectively belong. For as the mightiest elephant is but a terrier\n",
      "to Leviathan, so, compared with Leviathan's tail, his trunk is but the\n",
      "stalk of a lily. The most direful blow from the elephant's trunk were as\n",
      "the playful tap of a fan, compared with the measureless crush and crash\n",
      "of the sperm whale's ponderous flukes, which in repeated instances have\n",
      "one after the other hurled entire boats with all their oars and crews\n",
      "into the air, very much as an Indian juggler tosses his balls.*\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "*Though all comparison in the way of general bulk between the whale\n",
      "and the elephant is preposterous, inasmuch as in that particular the\n",
      "elephant stands in much the same respect to the whale that a dog does to\n",
      "the elephant; nevertheless, there are not wanting some points of curious\n",
      "similitude; among these is the spout. It is well known that the elephant\n",
      "will often draw up water or dust in his trunk, and then elevating it,\n",
      "jet it forth in a stream.\n",

      "The more I consider this mighty tail, the more do I deplore my inability\n",
      "to express it. At times there are gestures in it, which, though they\n",
      "would well grace the hand of man, remain wholly inexplicable. In an\n",
      "extensive herd, so remarkable, occasionally, are these mystic gestures,\n",
      "that I have heard hunters who have declared them akin to Free-Mason\n",
      "signs and symbols; that the whale, indeed, by these methods\n",
      "intelligently conversed with the world. Nor are there wanting other\n",
      "motions of the whale in his general body, full of strangeness, and\n",
      "unaccountable to his most experienced assailant. Dissect him how I may,\n",
      "then, I but go skin deep; I know him not, and never will. But if I know\n",
      "not even the tail of this whale, how understand his head? much more,\n",

      "drink before the brackish fluid, but yesterday rafted off in casks, from\n",
      "the Peruvian or Indian streams. Hence it is, that, while other ships may\n",

      "of ports, the whale-ship, in all that interval, may not have sighted\n",
      "one grain of soil; her crew having seen no man but floating seamen like\n",

      "Now, as many Sperm Whales had been captured off the western coast of\n",
      "Java, in the near vicinity of the Straits of Sunda; indeed, as most of\n",
      "the ground, roundabout, was generally recognised by the fishermen as an\n",
      "excellent spot for cruising; therefore, as the Pequod gained more\n",
      "and more upon Java Head, the look-outs were repeatedly hailed, and\n",
      "admonished to keep wide awake. But though the green palmy cliffs of the\n",
      "land soon loomed on the starboard bow, and with delighted nostrils\n",
      "the fresh cinnamon was snuffed in the air, yet not a single jet was\n",

      "hereabouts, the ship had well nigh entered the straits, when the\n",
      "customary cheering cry was heard from aloft, and ere long a spectacle of\n",
      "singular magnificence saluted us.\n",
      "\n",
      "But here be it premised, that owing to the unwearied activity with which\n",

      "numerous nations of them had sworn solemn league and covenant for mutual\n",
      "assistance and protection. To this aggregation of the Sperm Whale into\n",
      "such immense caravans, may be imputed the circumstance that even in the\n",
      "best cruising grounds, you may now sometimes sail for weeks and months\n",
      "together, without being greeted by a single spout; and then be suddenly\n",
      "saluted by what sometimes seems thousands on thousands.\n",

      "Broad on both bows, at the distance of some two or three miles, and\n",
      "forming a great semicircle, embracing one half of the level horizon,\n",

      "chased through these Straits of Sunda, the vast host would only deploy\n",
      "into the Oriental seas to witness the capture of not a few of their\n",

      "Dick himself might not temporarily be swimming, like the worshipped\n",
      "white-elephant in the coronation procession of the Siamese! So with\n",
      "stun-sail piled on stun-sail, we sailed along, driving these leviathans\n",

      "\n",
      "Corresponding to the crescent in our van, we beheld another in our rear.\n",
      "It seemed formed of detached white vapours, rising and falling something\n",

      "Pequod, with a fresh leading wind, was herself in hot chase; how very\n",
      "kind of these tawny philanthropists to assist in speeding her on to\n",
      "her own chosen pursuit,--mere riding-whips and rowels to her, that they\n",
      "were. As with glass under arm, Ahab to-and-fro paced the deck; in his\n",
      "forward turn beholding the monsters he chased, and in the after one the\n",
      "bloodthirsty pirates chasing him; some such fancy as the above seemed\n",
      "his. And when he glanced upon the green walls of the watery defile in\n",
      "which the ship was then sailing, and bethought him that through that\n",
      "gate lay the route to his vengeance, and beheld, how that through that\n",
      "same gate he was now both chasing and being chased to his deadly end;\n",
      "and not only that, but a herd of remorseless wild pirates and\n",
      "inhuman atheistical devils were infernally cheering him on with their\n",
      "curses;--when all these conceits had passed through his brain, Ahab's\n",
      "brow was left gaunt and ribbed, like the black sand beach after some\n",
      "stormy tide has been gnawing it, without being able to drag the firm\n",
      "thing from its place.\n",
      "\n",
      "But thoughts like these troubled very few of the reckless crew; and\n",
      "when, after steadily dropping and dropping the pirates astern, the\n",
      "Pequod at last shot by the vivid green Cockatoo Point on the Sumatra\n",
      "side, emerging at last upon the broad waters beyond; then, the\n",
      "harpooneers seemed more to grieve that the swift whales had been gaining\n",
      "upon the ship, than to rejoice that the ship had so victoriously gained\n",
      "upon the Malays. But still driving on in the wake of the whales, at\n",
      "length they seemed abating their speed; gradually the ship neared them;\n",
      "and the wind now dying away, word was passed to spring to the boats. But\n",
      "no sooner did the herd, by some presumed wonderful instinct of the Sperm\n",
      "Whale, become notified of the three keels that were after them,--though\n",
      "as yet a mile in their rear,--than they rallied again, and forming\n",
      "in close ranks and battalions, so that their spouts all looked like\n",
      "flashing lines of stacked bayonets, moved on with redoubled velocity.\n",
      "\n",
      "Stripped to our shirts and drawers, we sprang to the white-ash, and\n",
      "after several hours' pulling were almost disposed to renounce the chase,\n",
      "when a general pausing commotion among the whales gave animating\n",
      "token that they were now at last under the influence of that strange\n",
      "perplexity of inert irresolution, which, when the fishermen perceive\n",
      "it in the whale, they say he is gallied. The compact martial columns\n",
      "in which they had been hitherto rapidly and steadily swimming, were now\n",
      "broken up in one measureless rout; and like King Porus' elephants in the\n",
      "Indian battle with Alexander, they seemed going mad with consternation.\n",
      "In all directions expanding in vast irregular circles, and aimlessly\n",
      "swimming hither and thither, by their short thick spoutings, they\n",
      "plainly betrayed their distraction of panic. This was still more\n",
      "strangely evinced by those of their number, who, completely paralysed\n",
      "as it were, helplessly floated like water-logged dismantled ships on the\n",
      "sea. Had these Leviathans been but a flock of simple sheep, pursued over\n",
      "the pasture by three fierce wolves, they could not possibly have evinced\n",
      "such excessive dismay. But this occasional timidity is characteristic\n",
      "of almost all herding creatures. Though banding together in tens of\n",
      "thousands, the lion-maned buffaloes of the West have fled before a\n",
      "solitary horseman. Witness, too, all human beings, how when herded\n",
      "together in the sheepfold of a theatre's pit, they will, at the\n",
      "slightest alarm of fire, rush helter-skelter for the outlets, crowding,\n",
      "trampling, jamming, and remorselessly dashing each other to death. Best,\n",
      "therefore, withhold any amazement at the strangely gallied whales\n",
      "before us, for there is no folly of the beasts of the earth which is not\n",
      "infinitely outdone by the madness of men.\n",
      "\n",
      "Though many of the whales, as has been said, were in violent motion,\n",
      "yet it is to be observed that as a whole the herd neither advanced nor\n",
      "retreated, but collectively remained in one place. As is customary in\n",
      "those cases, the boats at once separated, each making for some one\n",
      "lone whale on the outskirts of the shoal. In about three minutes' time,\n",
      "Queequeg's harpoon was flung; the stricken fish darted blinding spray\n",
      "in our faces, and then running away with us like light, steered straight\n",
      "for the heart of the herd. Though such a movement on the part of the\n",
      "whale struck under such circumstances, is in no wise unprecedented; and\n",
      "indeed is almost always more or less anticipated; yet does it present\n",
      "one of the more perilous vicissitudes of the fishery. For as the swift\n",
      "monster drags you deeper and deeper into the frantic shoal, you bid\n",
      "adieu to circumspect life and only exist in a delirious throb.\n",
      "\n",
      "As, blind and deaf, the whale plunged forward, as if by sheer power of\n",
      "speed to rid himself of the iron leech that had fastened to him; as we\n",
      "thus tore a white gash in the sea, on all sides menaced as we flew, by\n",
      "the crazed creatures to and fro rushing about us; our beset boat was\n",
      "like a ship mobbed by ice-isles in a tempest, and striving to steer\n",
      "through their complicated channels and straits, knowing not at what\n",
      "moment it may be locked in and crushed.\n",
      "\n",
      "But not a bit daunted, Queequeg steered us manfully; now sheering off\n",
      "from this monster directly across our route in advance; now edging away\n",
      "from that, whose colossal flukes were suspended overhead, while all the\n",
      "time, Starbuck stood up in the bows, lance in hand, pricking out of our\n",
      "way whatever whales he could reach by short darts, for there was no time\n",
      "to make long ones. Nor were the oarsmen quite idle, though their wonted\n",
      "duty was now altogether dispensed with. They chiefly attended to the\n",
      "shouting part of the business. \"Out of the way, Commodore!\" cried one,\n",
      "to a great dromedary that of a sudden rose bodily to the surface,\n",
      "and for an instant threatened to swamp us. \"Hard down with your tail,\n",
      "there!\" cried a second to another, which, close to our gunwale, seemed\n",
      "calmly cooling himself with his own fan-like extremity.\n",
      "\n",
      "All whaleboats carry certain curious contrivances, originally invented\n",
      "by the Nantucket Indians, called druggs. Two thick squares of wood\n",
      "of equal size are stoutly clenched together, so that they cross each\n",
      "other's grain at right angles; a line of considerable length is then\n",
      "attached to the middle of this block, and the other end of the line\n",
      "being looped, it can in a moment be fastened to a harpoon. It is chiefly\n",
      "among gallied whales that this drugg is used. For then, more whales\n",
      "are close round you than you can possibly chase at one time. But sperm\n",
      "whales are not every day encountered; while you may, then, you must\n",
      "kill all you can. And if you cannot kill them all at once, you must wing\n",
      "them, so that they can be afterwards killed at your leisure. Hence it\n",
      "is, that at times like these the drugg, comes into requisition. Our boat\n",
      "was furnished with three of them. The first and second were successfully\n",
      "darted, and we saw the whales staggeringly running off, fettered by the\n",
      "enormous sidelong resistance of the towing drugg. They were cramped like\n",
      "malefactors with the chain and ball. But upon flinging the third, in the\n",
      "act of tossing overboard the clumsy wooden block, it caught under one\n",
      "of the seats of the boat, and in an instant tore it out and carried it\n",
      "away, dropping the oarsman in the boat's bottom as the seat slid from\n",
      "under him. On both sides the sea came in at the wounded planks, but we\n",
      "stuffed two or three drawers and shirts in, and so stopped the leaks for\n",
      "the time.\n",
      "\n",
      "It had been next to impossible to dart these drugged-harpoons, were\n",
      "it not that as we advanced into the herd, our whale's way greatly\n",
      "diminished; moreover, that as we went still further and further from the\n",
      "circumference of commotion, the direful disorders seemed waning. So that\n",
      "when at last the jerking harpoon drew out, and the towing whale sideways\n",
      "vanished; then, with the tapering force of his parting momentum, we\n",
      "glided between two whales into the innermost heart of the shoal, as if\n",
      "from some mountain torrent we had slid into a serene valley lake. Here\n",
      "the storms in the roaring glens between the outermost whales, were heard\n",
      "but not felt. In this central expanse the sea presented that smooth\n",
      "satin-like surface, called a sleek, produced by the subtle moisture\n",
      "thrown off by the whale in his more quiet moods. Yes, we were now\n",
      "in that enchanted calm which they say lurks at the heart of every\n",
      "commotion. And still in the distracted distance we beheld the tumults of\n",
      "the outer concentric circles, and saw successive pods of whales, eight\n",
      "or ten in each, swiftly going round and round, like multiplied spans of\n",
      "horses in a ring; and so closely shoulder to shoulder, that a Titanic\n",
      "circus-rider might easily have over-arched the middle ones, and so have\n",
      "gone round on their backs. Owing to the density of the crowd of reposing\n",
      "whales, more immediately surrounding the embayed axis of the herd, no\n",
      "possible chance of escape was at present afforded us. We must watch for\n",
      "a breach in the living wall that hemmed us in; the wall that had only\n",
      "admitted us in order to shut us up. Keeping at the centre of the lake,\n",
      "we were occasionally visited by small tame cows and calves; the women\n",
      "and children of this routed host.\n",
      "\n",
      "Now, inclusive of the occasional wide intervals between the revolving\n",
      "outer circles, and inclusive of the spaces between the various pods in\n",
      "any one of those circles, the entire area at this juncture, embraced by\n",
      "the whole multitude, must have contained at least two or three square\n",
      "miles. At any rate--though indeed such a test at such a time might be\n",
      "deceptive--spoutings might be discovered from our low boat that\n",
      "seemed playing up almost from the rim of the horizon. I mention this\n",
      "circumstance, because, as if the cows and calves had been purposely\n",
      "locked up in this innermost fold; and as if the wide extent of the\n",
      "herd had hitherto prevented them from learning the precise cause of its\n",
      "stopping; or, possibly, being so young, unsophisticated, and every way\n",
      "innocent and inexperienced; however it may have been, these smaller\n",
      "whales--now and then visiting our becalmed boat from the margin of the\n",
      "lake--evinced a wondrous fearlessness and confidence, or else a still\n",
      "becharmed panic which it was impossible not to marvel at. Like household\n",
      "dogs they came snuffling round us, right up to our gunwales, and\n",
      "touching them; till it almost seemed that some spell had suddenly\n",
      "domesticated them. Queequeg patted their foreheads; Starbuck scratched\n",
      "their backs with his lance; but fearful of the consequences, for the\n",
      "time refrained from darting it.\n",
      "\n",
      "But far beneath this wondrous world upon the surface, another and still\n",
      "stranger world met our eyes as we gazed over the side. For, suspended\n",
      "in those watery vaults, floated the forms of the nursing mothers of the\n",
      "whales, and those that by their enormous girth seemed shortly to\n",
      "become mothers. The lake, as I have hinted, was to a considerable depth\n",
      "exceedingly transparent; and as human infants while suckling will calmly\n",
      "and fixedly gaze away from the breast, as if leading two different\n",
      "lives at the time; and while yet drawing mortal nourishment, be still\n",
      "spiritually feasting upon some unearthly reminiscence;--even so did the\n",
      "young of these whales seem looking up towards us, but not at us, as if\n",
      "we were but a bit of Gulfweed in their new-born sight. Floating on their\n",
      "sides, the mothers also seemed quietly eyeing us. One of these little\n",
      "infants, that from certain queer tokens seemed hardly a day old, might\n",
      "have measured some fourteen feet in length, and some six feet in\n",
      "girth. He was a little frisky; though as yet his body seemed scarce yet\n",
      "recovered from that irksome position it had so lately occupied in the\n",
      "maternal reticule; where, tail to head, and all ready for the final\n",
      "spring, the unborn whale lies bent like a Tartar's bow. The delicate\n",
      "side-fins, and the palms of his flukes, still freshly retained the\n",
      "plaited crumpled appearance of a baby's ears newly arrived from foreign\n",
      "parts.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Line! line!\" cried Queequeg, looking over the gunwale; \"him fast! him\n",
      "fast!--Who line him! Who struck?--Two whale; one big, one little!\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"What ails ye, man?\" cried Starbuck.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Look-e here,\" said Queequeg, pointing down.\n",
      "\n",
      "As when the stricken whale, that from the tub has reeled out hundreds of\n",
      "fathoms of rope; as, after deep sounding, he floats up again, and shows\n",
      "the slackened curling line buoyantly rising and spiralling towards the\n",
      "air; so now, Starbuck saw long coils of the umbilical cord of Madame\n",
      "Leviathan, by which the young cub seemed still tethered to its dam. Not\n",
      "seldom in the rapid vicissitudes of the chase, this natural line, with\n",
      "the maternal end loose, becomes entangled with the hempen one, so that\n",
      "the cub is thereby trapped. Some of the subtlest secrets of the seas\n",
      "seemed divulged to us in this enchanted pond. We saw young Leviathan\n",
      "amours in the deep.*\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "*The sperm whale, as with all other species of the Leviathan, but unlike\n",
      "most other fish, breeds indifferently at all seasons; after a gestation\n",
      "which may probably be set down at nine months, producing but one at a\n",
      "time; though in some few known instances giving birth to an Esau and\n",
      "Jacob:--a contingency provided for in suckling by two teats, curiously\n",
      "situated, one on each side of the anus; but the breasts themselves\n",
      "extend upwards from that. When by chance these precious parts in a\n",
      "nursing whale are cut by the hunter's lance, the mother's pouring milk\n",
      "and blood rivallingly discolour the sea for rods. The milk is very sweet\n",
      "and rich; it has been tasted by man; it might do well with strawberries.\n",
      "When overflowing with mutual esteem, the whales salute MORE HOMINUM.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "And thus, though surrounded by circle upon circle of consternations\n",
      "and affrights, did these inscrutable creatures at the centre freely and\n",
      "fearlessly indulge in all peaceful concernments; yea, serenely revelled\n",
      "in dalliance and delight. But even so, amid the tornadoed Atlantic of\n",
      "my being, do I myself still for ever centrally disport in mute calm; and\n",
      "while ponderous planets of unwaning woe revolve round me, deep down and\n",
      "deep inland there I still bathe me in eternal mildness of joy.\n",
      "\n",
      "Meanwhile, as we thus lay entranced, the occasional sudden frantic\n",

      "possibly carrying on the war within the first circle, where abundance of\n",
      "room and some convenient retreats were afforded them. But the sight\n",
      "of the enraged drugged whales now and then blindly darting to and fro\n",
      "across the circles, was nothing to what at last met our eyes. It is\n",

      "heave and swell; the submarine bridal-chambers and nurseries vanished;\n",
      "in more and more contracting orbits the whales in the more central\n",

      "the course of years, repenting of that step, he instituted an action to\n",

      "acquired a property in those articles; and hence anybody who afterwards\n",

      "It was a week or two after the last whaling scene recounted, and when we\n",
      "were slowly sailing over a sleepy, vapoury, mid-day sea, that the many\n",
      "noses on the Pequod's deck proved more vigilant discoverers than the\n",

      "\n",
      "Presently, the vapours in advance slid aside; and there in the distance\n",
      "lay a ship, whose furled sails betokened that some sort of whale must be\n",
      "alongside. As we glided nearer, the stranger showed French colours from\n",
      "his peak; and by the eddying cloud of vulture sea-fowl that circled, and\n",
      "hovered, and swooped around him, it was plain that the whale alongside\n",
      "must be what the fishermen call a blasted whale, that is, a whale that\n",
      "has died unmolested on the sea, and so floated an unappropriated corpse.\n",
      "It may well be conceived, what an unsavory odor such a mass must\n",
      "exhale; worse than an Assyrian city in the plague, when the living are\n",
      "incompetent to bury the departed. So intolerable indeed is it regarded\n",

      "Coming still nearer with the expiring breeze, we saw that the Frenchman\n",
      "had a second whale alongside; and this second whale seemed even more\n",
      "of a nosegay than the first. In truth, it turned out to be one of\n",
      "those problematical whales that seem to dry up and die with a sort\n",
      "of prodigious dyspepsia, or indigestion; leaving their defunct bodies\n",
      "almost entirely bankrupt of anything like oil. Nevertheless, in the\n",

      "tallow candles, and cases of snuffers, foreseeing that all the oil they\n",

      "devil! I say, pass round a hat, some one, and let's make him a present\n",

      "By this time the faint air had become a complete calm; so that whether\n",
      "or no, the Pequod was now fairly entrapped in the smell, with no hope of\n",
      "escaping except by its breezing up again. Issuing from the cabin, Stubb\n",
      "now called his boat's crew, and pulled off for the stranger. Drawing\n",
      "across her bow, he perceived that in accordance with the fanciful French\n",
      "taste, the upper part of her stem-piece was carved in the likeness of a\n",
      "huge drooping stalk, was painted green, and for thorns had copper\n",
      "spikes projecting from it here and there; the whole terminating in a\n",
      "symmetrical folded bulb of a bright red colour. Upon her head boards, in\n",
      "large gilt letters, he read \"Bouton de Rose,\"--Rose-button, or Rose-bud;\n",
      "and this was the romantic name of this aromatic ship.\n",
      "\n",
      "Though Stubb did not understand the BOUTON part of the inscription, yet\n",
      "the word ROSE, and the bulbous figure-head put together, sufficiently\n",
      "explained the whole to him.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"A wooden rose-bud, eh?\" he cried with his hand to his nose, \"that will\n",
      "do very well; but how like all creation it smells!\"\n",
      "\n",
      "Now in order to hold direct communication with the people on deck, he\n",
      "had to pull round the bows to the starboard side, and thus come close to\n",
      "the blasted whale; and so talk over it.\n",
      "\n",
      "Arrived then at this spot, with one hand still to his nose, he\n",
      "bawled--\"Bouton-de-Rose, ahoy! are there any of you Bouton-de-Roses that\n",
      "speak English?\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Yes,\" rejoined a Guernsey-man from the bulwarks, who turned out to be\n",
      "the chief-mate.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Well, then, my Bouton-de-Rose-bud, have you seen the White Whale?\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"WHAT whale?\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"The WHITE Whale--a Sperm Whale--Moby Dick, have ye seen him?\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Never heard of such a whale. Cachalot Blanche! White Whale--no.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Very good, then; good bye now, and I'll call again in a minute.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "Then rapidly pulling back towards the Pequod, and seeing Ahab leaning\n",
      "over the quarter-deck rail awaiting his report, he moulded his two hands\n",
      "into a trumpet and shouted--\"No, Sir! No!\" Upon which Ahab retired, and\n",
      "Stubb returned to the Frenchman.\n",
      "\n",
      "He now perceived that the Guernsey-man, who had just got into the\n",
      "chains, and was using a cutting-spade, had slung his nose in a sort of\n",
      "bag.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"What's the matter with your nose, there?\" said Stubb. \"Broke it?\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"I wish it was broken, or that I didn't have any nose at all!\" answered\n",
      "the Guernsey-man, who did not seem to relish the job he was at very\n",
      "much. \"But what are you holding YOURS for?\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Oh, nothing! It's a wax nose; I have to hold it on. Fine day, ain't it?\n",
      "Air rather gardenny, I should say; throw us a bunch of posies, will ye,\n",
      "Bouton-de-Rose?\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"What in the devil's name do you want here?\" roared the Guernseyman,\n",
      "flying into a sudden passion.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Oh! keep cool--cool? yes, that's the word! why don't you pack those\n",
      "whales in ice while you're working at 'em? But joking aside, though; do\n",
      "you know, Rose-bud, that it's all nonsense trying to get any oil out of\n",
      "such whales? As for that dried up one, there, he hasn't a gill in his\n",
      "whole carcase.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"I know that well enough; but, d'ye see, the Captain here won't believe\n",
      "it; this is his first voyage; he was a Cologne manufacturer before. But\n",
      "come aboard, and mayhap he'll believe you, if he won't me; and so I'll\n",
      "get out of this dirty scrape.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Anything to oblige ye, my sweet and pleasant fellow,\" rejoined Stubb,\n",
      "and with that he soon mounted to the deck. There a queer scene presented\n",
      "itself. The sailors, in tasselled caps of red worsted, were getting the\n",
      "heavy tackles in readiness for the whales. But they worked rather slow\n",
      "and talked very fast, and seemed in anything but a good humor. All their\n",
      "noses upwardly projected from their faces like so many jib-booms.\n",
      "Now and then pairs of them would drop their work, and run up to the\n",
      "mast-head to get some fresh air. Some thinking they would catch the\n",
      "plague, dipped oakum in coal-tar, and at intervals held it to their\n",
      "nostrils. Others having broken the stems of their pipes almost short\n",
      "off at the bowl, were vigorously puffing tobacco-smoke, so that it\n",
      "constantly filled their olfactories.\n",
      "\n",
      "Stubb was struck by a shower of outcries and anathemas proceeding from\n",
      "the Captain's round-house abaft; and looking in that direction saw a\n",
      "fiery face thrust from behind the door, which was held ajar from within.\n",
      "This was the tormented surgeon, who, after in vain remonstrating\n",
      "against the proceedings of the day, had betaken himself to the Captain's\n",
      "round-house (CABINET he called it) to avoid the pest; but still, could\n",
      "not help yelling out his entreaties and indignations at times.\n",
      "\n",
      "Marking all this, Stubb argued well for his scheme, and turning to the\n",
      "Guernsey-man had a little chat with him, during which the stranger mate\n",
      "expressed his detestation of his Captain as a conceited ignoramus,\n",
      "who had brought them all into so unsavory and unprofitable a pickle.\n",
      "Sounding him carefully, Stubb further perceived that the Guernsey-man\n",
      "had not the slightest suspicion concerning the ambergris. He therefore\n",
      "held his peace on that head, but otherwise was quite frank and\n",
      "confidential with him, so that the two quickly concocted a little plan\n",
      "for both circumventing and satirizing the Captain, without his at all\n",
      "dreaming of distrusting their sincerity. According to this little plan\n",
      "of theirs, the Guernsey-man, under cover of an interpreter's office, was\n",
      "to tell the Captain what he pleased, but as coming from Stubb; and as\n",
      "for Stubb, he was to utter any nonsense that should come uppermost in\n",
      "him during the interview.\n",
      "\n",
      "By this time their destined victim appeared from his cabin. He was a\n",
      "small and dark, but rather delicate looking man for a sea-captain, with\n",
      "large whiskers and moustache, however; and wore a red cotton velvet vest\n",
      "with watch-seals at his side. To this gentleman, Stubb was now politely\n",
      "introduced by the Guernsey-man, who at once ostentatiously put on the\n",
      "aspect of interpreting between them.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"What shall I say to him first?\" said he.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Why,\" said Stubb, eyeing the velvet vest and the watch and seals, \"you\n",
      "may as well begin by telling him that he looks a sort of babyish to me,\n",
      "though I don't pretend to be a judge.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"He says, Monsieur,\" said the Guernsey-man, in French, turning to his\n",
      "captain, \"that only yesterday his ship spoke a vessel, whose captain\n",
      "and chief-mate, with six sailors, had all died of a fever caught from a\n",
      "blasted whale they had brought alongside.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "Upon this the captain started, and eagerly desired to know more.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"What now?\" said the Guernsey-man to Stubb.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Why, since he takes it so easy, tell him that now I have eyed him\n",
      "carefully, I'm quite certain that he's no more fit to command a\n",
      "whale-ship than a St. Jago monkey. In fact, tell him from me he's a\n",
      "baboon.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"He vows and declares, Monsieur, that the other whale, the dried one, is\n",
      "far more deadly than the blasted one; in fine, Monsieur, he conjures us,\n",
      "as we value our lives, to cut loose from these fish.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "Instantly the captain ran forward, and in a loud voice commanded his\n",
      "crew to desist from hoisting the cutting-tackles, and at once cast loose\n",
      "the cables and chains confining the whales to the ship.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"What now?\" said the Guernsey-man, when the Captain had returned to\n",
      "them.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Why, let me see; yes, you may as well tell him now that--that--in\n",
      "fact, tell him I've diddled him, and (aside to himself) perhaps somebody\n",
      "else.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"He says, Monsieur, that he's very happy to have been of any service to\n",
      "us.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "Hearing this, the captain vowed that they were the grateful parties\n",
      "(meaning himself and mate) and concluded by inviting Stubb down into his\n",
      "cabin to drink a bottle of Bordeaux.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"He wants you to take a glass of wine with him,\" said the interpreter.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Thank him heartily; but tell him it's against my principles to drink\n",
      "with the man I've diddled. In fact, tell him I must go.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"He says, Monsieur, that his principles won't admit of his drinking; but\n",
      "that if Monsieur wants to live another day to drink, then Monsieur had\n",
      "best drop all four boats, and pull the ship away from these whales, for\n",
      "it's so calm they won't drift.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "By this time Stubb was over the side, and getting into his boat, hailed\n",
      "the Guernsey-man to this effect,--that having a long tow-line in his\n",
      "boat, he would do what he could to help them, by pulling out the lighter\n",
      "whale of the two from the ship's side. While the Frenchman's boats,\n",
      "then, were engaged in towing the ship one way, Stubb benevolently towed\n",
      "away at his whale the other way, ostentatiously slacking out a most\n",
      "unusually long tow-line.\n",
      "\n",
      "Presently a breeze sprang up; Stubb feigned to cast off from the whale;\n",
      "hoisting his boats, the Frenchman soon increased his distance, while the\n",
      "Pequod slid in between him and Stubb's whale. Whereupon Stubb quickly\n",
      "pulled to the floating body, and hailing the Pequod to give notice of\n",
      "his intentions, at once proceeded to reap the fruit of his unrighteous\n",
      "cunning. Seizing his sharp boat-spade, he commenced an excavation in the\n",
      "body, a little behind the side fin. You would almost have thought he was\n",
      "digging a cellar there in the sea; and when at length his spade struck\n",
      "against the gaunt ribs, it was like turning up old Roman tiles and\n",
      "pottery buried in fat English loam. His boat's crew were all in high\n",
      "excitement, eagerly helping their chief, and looking as anxious as\n",
      "gold-hunters.\n",
      "\n",
      "And all the time numberless fowls were diving, and ducking, and\n",
      "screaming, and yelling, and fighting around them. Stubb was beginning\n",
      "to look disappointed, especially as the horrible nosegay increased, when\n",
      "suddenly from out the very heart of this plague, there stole a faint\n",
      "stream of perfume, which flowed through the tide of bad smells without\n",
      "being absorbed by it, as one river will flow into and then along with\n",
      "another, without at all blending with it for a time.\n",
      "\n",

      "Now this ambergris is a very curious substance, and so important as\n",
      "an article of commerce, that in 1791 a certain Nantucket-born Captain\n",
      "Coffin was examined at the bar of the English House of Commons on that\n",
      "subject. For at that time, and indeed until a comparatively late day,\n",
      "the precise origin of ambergris remained, like amber itself, a problem\n",
      "to the learned. Though the word ambergris is but the French compound for\n",
      "grey amber, yet the two substances are quite distinct. For amber, though\n",
      "at times found on the sea-coast, is also dug up in some far inland\n",
      "soils, whereas ambergris is never found except upon the sea. Besides,\n",
      "amber is a hard, transparent, brittle, odorless substance, used for\n",
      "mouth-pieces to pipes, for beads and ornaments; but ambergris is soft,\n",
      "waxy, and so highly fragrant and spicy, that it is largely used in\n",
      "perfumery, in pastiles, precious candles, hair-powders, and pomatum.\n",
      "The Turks use it in cooking, and also carry it to Mecca, for the same\n",

      "Who would think, then, that such fine ladies and gentlemen should regale\n",
      "themselves with an essence found in the inglorious bowels of a sick\n",
      "whale! Yet so it is. By some, ambergris is supposed to be the cause, and\n",
      "by others the effect, of the dyspepsia in the whale. How to cure such\n",
      "a dyspepsia it were hard to say, unless by administering three or four\n",
      "boat loads of Brandreth's pills, and then running out of harm's way, as\n",
      "laborers do in blasting rocks.\n",
      "\n",
      "I have forgotten to say that there were found in this ambergris, certain\n",
      "hard, round, bony plates, which at first Stubb thought might be sailors'\n",
      "trowsers buttons; but it afterwards turned out that they were nothing\n",
      "more than pieces of small squid bones embalmed in that manner.\n",
      "\n",
      "Now that the incorruption of this most fragrant ambergris should be\n",
      "found in the heart of such decay; is this nothing? Bethink thee of that\n",
      "saying of St. Paul in Corinthians, about corruption and incorruption;\n",
      "how that we are sown in dishonour, but raised in glory. And likewise\n",

      "I should like to conclude the chapter with the above appeal, but cannot,\n",

      "considered as indirectly substantiated by what has been said of\n",

      "a slatternly, untidy business. But there is another thing to rebut. They\n",
      "hint that all whales always smell bad. Now how did this odious stigma\n",
      "originate?\n",
      "\n",
      "I opine, that it is plainly traceable to the first arrival of the\n",
      "Greenland whaling ships in London, more than two centuries ago. Because\n",
      "those whalemen did not then, and do not now, try out their oil at sea as\n",
      "the Southern ships have always done; but cutting up the fresh blubber in\n",
      "small bits, thrust it through the bung holes of large casks, and carry\n",
      "it home in that manner; the shortness of the season in those Icy Seas,\n",
      "and the sudden and violent storms to which they are exposed, forbidding\n",
      "any other course. The consequence is, that upon breaking into the hold,\n",
      "and unloading one of these whale cemeteries, in the Greenland dock, a\n",
      "savor is given forth somewhat similar to that arising from excavating an\n",
      "old city grave-yard, for the foundations of a Lying-in-Hospital.\n",
      "\n",
      "I partly surmise also, that this wicked charge against whalers may be\n",
      "likewise imputed to the existence on the coast of Greenland, in former\n",
      "times, of a Dutch village called Schmerenburgh or Smeerenberg, which\n",
      "latter name is the one used by the learned Fogo Von Slack, in his great\n",
      "work on Smells, a text-book on that subject. As its name imports (smeer,\n",
      "fat; berg, to put up), this village was founded in order to afford a\n",
      "place for the blubber of the Dutch whale fleet to be tried out, without\n",
      "being taken home to Holland for that purpose. It was a collection of\n",
      "furnaces, fat-kettles, and oil sheds; and when the works were in full\n",
      "operation certainly gave forth no very pleasant savor. But all this is\n",
      "quite different with a South Sea Sperm Whaler; which in a voyage of four\n",
      "years perhaps, after completely filling her hold with oil, does not,\n",
      "perhaps, consume fifty days in the business of boiling out; and in the\n",
      "state that it is casked, the oil is nearly scentless. The truth is, that\n",
      "living or dead, if but decently treated, whales as a species are by\n",
      "no means creatures of ill odor; nor can whalemen be recognised, as the\n",
      "people of the middle ages affected to detect a Jew in the company, by\n",
      "the nose. Nor indeed can the whale possibly be otherwise than fragrant,\n",
      "when, as a general thing, he enjoys such high health; taking abundance\n",
      "of exercise; always out of doors; though, it is true, seldom in the\n",
      "open air. I say, that the motion of a Sperm Whale's flukes above water\n",
      "dispenses a perfume, as when a musk-scented lady rustles her dress in a\n",

      "\n",
      "It came to pass, that in the ambergris affair Stubb's after-oarsman\n",
      "chanced so to sprain his hand, as for a time to become quite maimed;\n",
      "and, temporarily, Pip was put into his place.\n",
      "\n",
      "The first time Stubb lowered with him, Pip evinced much nervousness;\n",
      "but happily, for that time, escaped close contact with the whale; and\n",
      "therefore came off not altogether discreditably; though Stubb observing\n",
      "him, took care, afterwards, to exhort him to cherish his courageousness\n",
      "to the utmost, for he might often find it needful.\n",
      "\n",
      "Now upon the second lowering, the boat paddled upon the whale; and as\n",
      "the fish received the darted iron, it gave its customary rap, which\n",
      "happened, in this instance, to be right under poor Pip's seat. The\n",
      "involuntary consternation of the moment caused him to leap, paddle in\n",
      "hand, out of the boat; and in such a way, that part of the slack whale\n",
      "line coming against his chest, he breasted it overboard with him, so as\n",
      "to become entangled in it, when at last plumping into the water. That\n",
      "instant the stricken whale started on a fierce run, the line swiftly\n",
      "straightened; and presto! poor Pip came all foaming up to the chocks\n",
      "of the boat, remorselessly dragged there by the line, which had taken\n",
      "several turns around his chest and neck.\n",
      "\n",
      "Tashtego stood in the bows. He was full of the fire of the hunt. He\n",
      "hated Pip for a poltroon. Snatching the boat-knife from its sheath,\n",
      "he suspended its sharp edge over the line, and turning towards Stubb,\n",
      "exclaimed interrogatively, \"Cut?\" Meantime Pip's blue, choked face\n",
      "plainly looked, Do, for God's sake! All passed in a flash. In less than\n",
      "half a minute, this entire thing happened.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Damn him, cut!\" roared Stubb; and so the whale was lost and Pip was\n",
      "saved.\n",
      "\n",
      "So soon as he recovered himself, the poor little negro was assailed\n",
      "by yells and execrations from the crew. Tranquilly permitting these\n",
      "irregular cursings to evaporate, Stubb then in a plain, business-like,\n",
      "but still half humorous manner, cursed Pip officially; and that done,\n",
      "unofficially gave him much wholesome advice. The substance was, Never\n",
      "jump from a boat, Pip, except--but all the rest was indefinite, as the\n",
      "soundest advice ever is. Now, in general, STICK TO THE BOAT, is your\n",
      "true motto in whaling; but cases will sometimes happen when LEAP FROM\n",
      "THE BOAT, is still better. Moreover, as if perceiving at last that if he\n",
      "should give undiluted conscientious advice to Pip, he would be leaving\n",
      "him too wide a margin to jump in for the future; Stubb suddenly dropped\n",
      "all advice, and concluded with a peremptory command, \"Stick to the boat,\n",
      "Pip, or by the Lord, I won't pick you up if you jump; mind that. We\n",
      "can't afford to lose whales by the likes of you; a whale would sell for\n",
      "thirty times what you would, Pip, in Alabama. Bear that in mind, and\n",
      "don't jump any more.\" Hereby perhaps Stubb indirectly hinted, that\n",
      "though man loved his fellow, yet man is a money-making animal, which\n",
      "propensity too often interferes with his benevolence.\n",
      "\n",
      "But we are all in the hands of the Gods; and Pip jumped again. It was\n",
      "under very similar circumstances to the first performance; but this time\n",
      "he did not breast out the line; and hence, when the whale started to\n",
      "run, Pip was left behind on the sea, like a hurried traveller's trunk.\n",
      "Alas! Stubb was but too true to his word. It was a beautiful, bounteous,\n",
      "blue day; the spangled sea calm and cool, and flatly stretching away,\n",
      "all round, to the horizon, like gold-beater's skin hammered out to the\n",
      "extremest. Bobbing up and down in that sea, Pip's ebon head showed\n",
      "like a head of cloves. No boat-knife was lifted when he fell so rapidly\n",
      "astern. Stubb's inexorable back was turned upon him; and the whale was\n",
      "winged. In three minutes, a whole mile of shoreless ocean was between\n",
      "Pip and Stubb. Out from the centre of the sea, poor Pip turned his\n",
      "crisp, curling, black head to the sun, another lonely castaway, though\n",
      "the loftiest and the brightest.\n",
      "\n",
      "Now, in calm weather, to swim in the open ocean is as easy to the\n",
      "practised swimmer as to ride in a spring-carriage ashore. But the awful\n",
      "lonesomeness is intolerable. The intense concentration of self in the\n",
      "middle of such a heartless immensity, my God! who can tell it? Mark, how\n",
      "when sailors in a dead calm bathe in the open sea--mark how closely they\n",
      "hug their ship and only coast along her sides.\n",
      "\n",
      "But had Stubb really abandoned the poor little negro to his fate? No; he\n",
      "did not mean to, at least. Because there were two boats in his wake,\n",
      "and he supposed, no doubt, that they would of course come up to Pip very\n",
      "quickly, and pick him up; though, indeed, such considerations towards\n",
      "oarsmen jeopardized through their own timidity, is not always manifested\n",
      "by the hunters in all similar instances; and such instances not\n",
      "unfrequently occur; almost invariably in the fishery, a coward, so\n",
      "called, is marked with the same ruthless detestation peculiar to\n",
      "military navies and armies.\n",
      "\n",
      "But it so happened, that those boats, without seeing Pip, suddenly\n",
      "spying whales close to them on one side, turned, and gave chase; and\n",
      "Stubb's boat was now so far away, and he and all his crew so intent\n",
      "upon his fish, that Pip's ringed horizon began to expand around him\n",
      "miserably. By the merest chance the ship itself at last rescued him; but\n",
      "from that hour the little negro went about the deck an idiot; such, at\n",
      "least, they said he was. The sea had jeeringly kept his finite body\n",
      "up, but drowned the infinite of his soul. Not drowned entirely, though.\n",
      "Rather carried down alive to wondrous depths, where strange shapes of\n",
      "the unwarped primal world glided to and fro before his passive eyes;\n",
      "and the miser-merman, Wisdom, revealed his hoarded heaps; and among the\n",
      "joyous, heartless, ever-juvenile eternities, Pip saw the multitudinous,\n",
      "God-omnipresent, coral insects, that out of the firmament of waters\n",
      "heaved the colossal orbs. He saw God's foot upon the treadle of the\n",
      "loom, and spoke it; and therefore his shipmates called him mad. So man's\n",
      "insanity is heaven's sense; and wandering from all mortal reason, man\n",
      "comes at last to that celestial thought, which, to reason, is absurd and\n",

      "my back to her prow and the compass. In an instant I faced back, just\n",
      "in time to prevent the vessel from flying up into the wind, and very\n",

      "he could hardly hope to attain.\n",
      "\n",
      "It has before been hinted, perhaps, that every little untoward\n",
      "circumstance that befell him, and which indirectly sprang from his\n",
      "luckless mishap, almost invariably irritated or exasperated Ahab. And\n",
      "in the present instance, all this was heightened by the sight of the\n",
      "two officers of the strange ship, leaning over the side, by the\n",
      "perpendicular ladder of nailed cleets there, and swinging towards him a\n",
      "pair of tastefully-ornamented man-ropes; for at first they did not seem\n",
      "to bethink them that a one-legged man must be too much of a cripple to\n",
      "use their sea bannisters. But this awkwardness only lasted a minute,\n",
      "because the strange captain, observing at a glance how affairs stood,\n",
      "cried out, \"I see, I see!--avast heaving there! Jump, boys, and swing\n",
      "over the cutting-tackle.\"\n",

      "As good luck would have it, they had had a whale alongside a day or two\n",
      "previous, and the great tackles were still aloft, and the massive curved\n",
      "blubber-hook, now clean and dry, was still attached to the end. This\n",
      "was quickly lowered to Ahab, who at once comprehending it all, slid his\n",
      "solitary thigh into the curve of the hook (it was like sitting in the\n",
      "fluke of an anchor, or the crotch of an apple tree), and then giving the\n",
      "word, held himself fast, and at the same time also helped to hoist his\n",
      "own weight, by pulling hand-over-hand upon one of the running parts of\n",
      "the tackle. Soon he was carefully swung inside the high bulwarks, and\n",
      "gently landed upon the capstan head. With his ivory arm frankly thrust\n",
      "forth in welcome, the other captain advanced, and Ahab, putting out his\n",
      "ivory leg, and crossing the ivory arm (like two sword-fish blades)\n",
      "cried out in his walrus way, \"Aye, aye, hearty! let us shake bones\n",
      "together!--an arm and a leg!--an arm that never can shrink, d'ye\n",
      "see; and a leg that never can run. Where did'st thou see the White\n",
      "Whale?--how long ago?\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"The White Whale,\" said the Englishman, pointing his ivory arm towards\n",
      "the East, and taking a rueful sight along it, as if it had been a\n",
      "telescope; \"there I saw him, on the Line, last season.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"And he took that arm off, did he?\" asked Ahab, now sliding down from\n",
      "the capstan, and resting on the Englishman's shoulder, as he did so.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Aye, he was the cause of it, at least; and that leg, too?\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Spin me the yarn,\" said Ahab; \"how was it?\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"It was the first time in my life that I ever cruised on the Line,\"\n",
      "began the Englishman. \"I was ignorant of the White Whale at that time.\n",
      "Well, one day we lowered for a pod of four or five whales, and my boat\n",
      "fastened to one of them; a regular circus horse he was, too, that went\n",
      "milling and milling round so, that my boat's crew could only trim dish,\n",
      "by sitting all their sterns on the outer gunwale. Presently up breaches\n",
      "from the bottom of the sea a bouncing great whale, with a milky-white\n",
      "head and hump, all crows' feet and wrinkles.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"It was he, it was he!\" cried Ahab, suddenly letting out his suspended\n",

      "\"And harpoons sticking in near his starboard fin.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Aye, aye--they were mine--MY irons,\" cried Ahab, exultingly--\"but on!\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Give me a chance, then,\" said the Englishman, good-humoredly. \"Well,\n",
      "this old great-grandfather, with the white head and hump, runs all afoam\n",
      "into the pod, and goes to snapping furiously at my fast-line!\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Aye, I see!--wanted to part it; free the fast-fish--an old trick--I\n",
      "know him.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"How it was exactly,\" continued the one-armed commander, \"I do not know;\n",
      "but in biting the line, it got foul of his teeth, caught there somehow;\n",
      "but we didn't know it then; so that when we afterwards pulled on the\n",
      "line, bounce we came plump on to his hump! instead of the other whale's;\n",
      "that went off to windward, all fluking. Seeing how matters stood, and\n",
      "what a noble great whale it was--the noblest and biggest I ever saw,\n",
      "sir, in my life--I resolved to capture him, spite of the boiling rage\n",
      "he seemed to be in. And thinking the hap-hazard line would get loose, or\n",
      "the tooth it was tangled to might draw (for I have a devil of a boat's\n",
      "crew for a pull on a whale-line); seeing all this, I say, I jumped\n",
      "into my first mate's boat--Mr. Mounttop's here (by the way,\n",
      "Captain--Mounttop; Mounttop--the captain);--as I was saying, I jumped\n",
      "into Mounttop's boat, which, d'ye see, was gunwale and gunwale\n",
      "with mine, then; and snatching the first harpoon, let this old\n",
      "great-grandfather have it. But, Lord, look you, sir--hearts and souls\n",
      "alive, man--the next instant, in a jiff, I was blind as a bat--both\n",
      "eyes out--all befogged and bedeadened with black foam--the whale's tail\n",
      "looming straight up out of it, perpendicular in the air, like a marble\n",
      "steeple. No use sterning all, then; but as I was groping at midday, with\n",
      "a blinding sun, all crown-jewels; as I was groping, I say, after the\n",
      "second iron, to toss it overboard--down comes the tail like a Lima\n",
      "tower, cutting my boat in two, leaving each half in splinters; and,\n",
      "flukes first, the white hump backed through the wreck, as though it was\n",
      "all chips. We all struck out. To escape his terrible flailings, I seized\n",
      "hold of my harpoon-pole sticking in him, and for a moment clung to that\n",
      "like a sucking fish. But a combing sea dashed me off, and at the same\n",
      "instant, the fish, taking one good dart forwards, went down like a\n",
      "flash; and the barb of that cursed second iron towing along near me\n",
      "caught me here\" (clapping his hand just below his shoulder); \"yes,\n",
      "caught me just here, I say, and bore me down to Hell's flames, I was\n",
      "thinking; when, when, all of a sudden, thank the good God, the barb ript\n",

      "The professional gentleman thus familiarly pointed out, had been all the\n",

      "gentlemanly rank on board. His face was an exceedingly round but sober\n",
      "one; he was dressed in a faded blue woollen frock or shirt, and patched\n",
      "trowsers; and had thus far been dividing his attention between a\n",
      "marlingspike he held in one hand, and a pill-box held in the other,\n",
      "occasionally casting a critical glance at the ivory limbs of the two\n",

      "best and severest endeavors, the wound kept getting worse and worse; the\n",
      "truth was, sir, it was as ugly gaping wound as surgeon ever saw; more\n",
      "than two feet and several inches long. I measured it with the lead line.\n",
      "In short, it grew black; I knew what was threatened, and off it came.\n",
      "But I had no hand in shipping that ivory arm there; that thing is\n",
      "against all rule\"--pointing at it with the marlingspike--\"that is the\n",

      "out with, I suppose, as he tried mine once. He flies into diabolical\n",
      "passions sometimes. Do ye see this dent, sir\"--removing his hat, and\n",
      "brushing aside his hair, and exposing a bowl-like cavity in his skull,\n",

      "\n",
      "\"Oh!\" cried the one-armed captain, \"oh, yes! Well; after he sounded,\n",

      "swallows.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Well, then,\" interrupted Bunger, \"give him your left arm for bait to\n",

      "bowing to each Captain in succession--\"Do you know, gentlemen, that the\n",
      "digestive organs of the whale are so inscrutably constructed by Divine\n",
      "Providence, that it is quite impossible for him to completely digest\n",
      "even a man's arm? And he knows it too. So that what you take for the\n",
      "White Whale's malice is only his awkwardness. For he never means\n",
      "to swallow a single limb; he only thinks to terrify by feints. But\n",
      "sometimes he is like the old juggling fellow, formerly a patient of mine\n",
      "in Ceylon, that making believe swallow jack-knives, once upon a time let\n",
      "one drop into him in good earnest, and there it stayed for a twelvemonth\n",
      "or more; when I gave him an emetic, and he heaved it up in small tacks,\n",
      "d'ye see. No possible way for him to digest that jack-knife, and fully\n",
      "incorporate it into his general bodily system. Yes, Captain Boomer, if\n",
      "you are quick enough about it, and have a mind to pawn one arm for the\n",
      "sake of the privilege of giving decent burial to the other, why in that\n",
      "case the arm is yours; only let the whale have another chance at you\n",
      "shortly, that's all.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"No, thank ye, Bunger,\" said the English Captain, \"he's welcome to the\n",

      "another one. No more White Whales for me; I've lowered for him once, and\n",
      "that has satisfied me. There would be great glory in killing him, I know\n",
      "that; and there is a ship-load of precious sperm in him, but, hark ye,\n",

      "the English, this thing of whaling good cheer is not normal and natural,\n",
      "but incidental and particular; and, therefore, must have some special\n",
      "origin, which is here pointed out, and will be still further elucidated.\n",

      "During my researches in the Leviathanic histories, I stumbled upon an\n",

      "knew must be about whalers. The title was, \"Dan Coopman,\" wherefore I\n",
      "concluded that this must be the invaluable memoirs of some Amsterdam\n",
      "cooper in the fishery, as every whale ship must carry its cooper. I was\n",
      "reinforced in this opinion by seeing that it was the production of one\n",
      "\"Fitz Swackhammer.\" But my friend Dr. Snodhead, a very learned man,\n",
      "professor of Low Dutch and High German in the college of Santa Claus and\n",
      "St. Pott's, to whom I handed the work for translation, giving him a box\n",
      "of sperm candles for his trouble--this same Dr. Snodhead, so soon as he\n",
      "spied the book, assured me that \"Dan Coopman\" did not mean \"The Cooper,\"\n",
      "but \"The Merchant.\" In short, this ancient and learned Low Dutch book\n",
      "treated of the commerce of Holland; and, among other subjects, contained\n",
      "a very interesting account of its whale fishery. And in this chapter it\n",
      "was, headed, \"Smeer,\" or \"Fat,\" that I found a long detailed list of the\n",
      "outfits for the larders and cellars of 180 sail of Dutch whalemen; from\n",
      "which list, as translated by Dr. Snodhead, I transcribe the following:\n",
      "\n",
      "400,000 lbs. of beef. 60,000 lbs. Friesland pork. 150,000 lbs. of stock\n",
      "fish. 550,000 lbs. of biscuit. 72,000 lbs. of soft bread. 2,800 firkins\n",
      "of butter. 20,000 lbs. Texel & Leyden cheese. 144,000 lbs. cheese\n",
      "(probably an inferior article). 550 ankers of Geneva. 10,800 barrels of\n",
      "beer.\n",
      "\n",
      "Most statistical tables are parchingly dry in the reading; not so in\n",
      "the present case, however, where the reader is flooded with whole pipes,\n",
      "barrels, quarts, and gills of good gin and good cheer.\n",
      "\n",
      "At the time, I devoted three days to the studious digesting of all\n",
      "this beer, beef, and bread, during which many profound thoughts were\n",
      "incidentally suggested to me, capable of a transcendental and Platonic\n",
      "application; and, furthermore, I compiled supplementary tables of my\n",
      "own, touching the probable quantity of stock-fish, etc., consumed by\n",
      "every Low Dutch harpooneer in that ancient Greenland and Spitzbergen\n",
      "whale fishery. In the first place, the amount of butter, and Texel and\n",
      "Leyden cheese consumed, seems amazing. I impute it, though, to their\n",
      "naturally unctuous natures, being rendered still more unctuous by the\n",
      "nature of their vocation, and especially by their pursuing their game\n",
      "in those frigid Polar Seas, on the very coasts of that Esquimaux country\n",
      "where the convivial natives pledge each other in bumpers of train oil.\n",
      "\n",
      "The quantity of beer, too, is very large, 10,800 barrels. Now, as those\n",
      "polar fisheries could only be prosecuted in the short summer of that\n",
      "climate, so that the whole cruise of one of these Dutch whalemen,\n",
      "including the short voyage to and from the Spitzbergen sea, did not much\n",
      "exceed three months, say, and reckoning 30 men to each of their fleet\n",
      "of 180 sail, we have 5,400 Low Dutch seamen in all; therefore, I say,\n",
      "we have precisely two barrels of beer per man, for a twelve weeks'\n",
      "allowance, exclusive of his fair proportion of that 550 ankers of gin.\n",
      "Now, whether these gin and beer harpooneers, so fuddled as one might\n",
      "fancy them to have been, were the right sort of men to stand up in\n",
      "a boat's head, and take good aim at flying whales; this would seem\n",
      "somewhat improbable. Yet they did aim at them, and hit them too. But\n",
      "this was very far North, be it remembered, where beer agrees well with\n",
      "the constitution; upon the Equator, in our southern fishery, beer would\n",
      "be apt to make the harpooneer sleepy at the mast-head and boozy in his\n",
      "boat; and grievous loss might ensue to Nantucket and New Bedford.\n",
      "\n",
      "But no more; enough has been said to show that the old Dutch whalers\n",
      "of two or three centuries ago were high livers; and that the English\n",
      "whalers have not neglected so excellent an example. For, say they, when\n",

      "Among many other fine qualities, my royal friend Tranquo, being gifted\n",
      "with a devout love for all matters of barbaric vertu, had brought\n",
      "together in Pupella whatever rare things the more ingenious of his\n",

      "chiselled shells, inlaid spears, costly paddles, aromatic canoes;\n",
      "and all these distributed among whatever natural wonders, the\n",
      "wonder-freighted, tribute-rendering waves had cast upon his shores.\n",
      "\n",
      "Chief among these latter was a great Sperm Whale, which, after an\n",
      "unusually long raging gale, had been found dead and stranded, with his\n",
      "head against a cocoa-nut tree, whose plumage-like, tufted droopings\n",
      "seemed his verdant jet. When the vast body had at last been stripped of\n",
      "its fathom-deep enfoldings, and the bones become dust dry in the sun,\n",

      "The ribs were hung with trophies; the vertebrae were carved with\n",

      "industrious earth beneath was as a weaver's loom, with a gorgeous carpet\n",
      "on it, whereof the ground-vine tendrils formed the warp and woof, and\n",
      "the living flowers the figures. All the trees, with all their laden\n",
      "branches; all the shrubs, and ferns, and grasses; the message-carrying\n",
      "air; all these unceasingly were active. Through the lacings of the\n",
      "leaves, the great sun seemed a flying shuttle weaving the unwearied\n",
      "verdure. Oh, busy weaver! unseen weaver!--pause!--one word!--whither\n",
      "flows the fabric? what palace may it deck? wherefore all these ceaseless\n",
      "toilings? Speak, weaver!--stay thy hand!--but one single word with\n",
      "thee! Nay--the shuttle flies--the figures float from forth the loom; the\n",
      "freshet-rushing carpet for ever slides away. The weaver-god, he weaves;\n",
      "and by that weaving is he deafened, that he hears no mortal voice; and\n",
      "by that humming, we, too, who look on the loom are deafened; and only\n",
      "when we escape it shall we hear the thousand voices that speak through\n",
      "it. For even so it is in all material factories. The spoken words that\n",
      "are inaudible among the flying spindles; those same words are plainly\n",
      "heard without the walls, bursting from the opened casements. Thereby\n",
      "have villainies been detected. Ah, mortal! then, be heedful; for so, in\n",

      "as the ever-woven verdant warp and woof intermixed and hummed around\n",
      "him, the mighty idler seemed the cunning weaver; himself all woven\n",
      "over with the vines; every month assuming greener, fresher verdure; but\n",

      "Now, when with royal Tranquo I visited this wondrous whale, and saw the\n",
      "skull an altar, and the artificial smoke ascending from where the real\n",
      "jet had issued, I marvelled that the king should regard a chapel as\n",
      "an object of vertu. He laughed. But more I marvelled that the priests\n",
      "should swear that smoky jet of his was genuine. To and fro I paced\n",
      "before this skeleton--brushed the vines aside--broke through the\n",
      "ribs--and with a ball of Arsacidean twine, wandered, eddied long amid\n",
      "its many winding, shaded colonnades and arbours. But soon my line was\n",

      "\n",
      "Cutting me a green measuring-rod, I once more dived within the skeleton.\n",
      "From their arrow-slit in the skull, the priests perceived me taking the\n",

      "this our god! That's for us.\" \"Aye, priests--well, how long do ye make\n",
      "him, then?\" But hereupon a fierce contest rose among them, concerning\n",
      "feet and inches; they cracked each other's sconces with their\n",
      "yard-sticks--the great skull echoed--and seizing that lucky chance, I\n",

      "it recorded, that, in this matter, I am not free to utter any fancied\n",
      "measurement I please. Because there are skeleton authorities you can\n",
      "refer to, to test my accuracy. There is a Leviathanic Museum, they tell\n",
      "me, in Hull, England, one of the whaling ports of that country, where\n",
      "they have some fine specimens of fin-backs and other whales. Likewise, I\n",
      "have heard that in the museum of Manchester, in New Hampshire, they have\n",
      "what the proprietors call \"the only perfect specimen of a Greenland or\n",

      "in his possession the skeleton of a Sperm Whale, but of moderate size,\n",
      "by no means of the full-grown magnitude of my friend King Tranquo's.\n",
      "\n",
      "In both cases, the stranded whales to which these two skeletons\n",
      "belonged, were originally claimed by their proprietors upon similar\n",
      "grounds. King Tranquo seizing his because he wanted it; and Sir\n",
      "Clifford, because he was lord of the seignories of those parts. Sir\n",
      "Clifford's whale has been articulated throughout; so that, like a\n",
      "great chest of drawers, you can open and shut him, in all his bony\n",
      "cavities--spread out his ribs like a gigantic fan--and swing all day\n",
      "upon his lower jaw. Locks are to be put upon some of his trap-doors and\n",
      "shutters; and a footman will show round future visitors with a bunch of\n",

      "In the first place, I wish to lay before you a particular, plain\n",
      "statement, touching the living bulk of this leviathan, whose skeleton we\n",
      "are briefly to exhibit. Such a statement may prove useful here.\n",
      "\n",
      "According to a careful calculation I have made, and which I partly base\n",
      "upon Captain Scoresby's estimate, of seventy tons for the largest\n",
      "sized Greenland whale of sixty feet in length; according to my careful\n",
      "calculation, I say, a Sperm Whale of the largest magnitude, between\n",
      "eighty-five and ninety feet in length, and something less than forty\n",
      "feet in its fullest circumference, such a whale will weigh at least\n",
      "ninety tons; so that, reckoning thirteen men to a ton, he would\n",
      "considerably outweigh the combined population of a whole village of one\n",
      "thousand one hundred inhabitants.\n",
      "\n",
      "Think you not then that brains, like yoked cattle, should be put to this\n",
      "leviathan, to make him at all budge to any landsman's imagination?\n",
      "\n",
      "Having already in various ways put before you his skull, spout-hole,\n",
      "jaw, teeth, tail, forehead, fins, and divers other parts, I shall now\n",
      "simply point out what is most interesting in the general bulk of his\n",
      "unobstructed bones. But as the colossal skull embraces so very large\n",
      "a proportion of the entire extent of the skeleton; as it is by far the\n",
      "most complicated part; and as nothing is to be repeated concerning it in\n",
      "this chapter, you must not fail to carry it in your mind, or under your\n",
      "arm, as we proceed, otherwise you will not gain a complete notion of the\n",
      "general structure we are about to view.\n",
      "\n",
      "In length, the Sperm Whale's skeleton at Tranque measured seventy-two\n",
      "Feet; so that when fully invested and extended in life, he must have\n",
      "been ninety feet long; for in the whale, the skeleton loses about one\n",
      "fifth in length compared with the living body. Of this seventy-two feet,\n",
      "his skull and jaw comprised some twenty feet, leaving some fifty feet of\n",
      "plain back-bone. Attached to this back-bone, for something less than a\n",
      "third of its length, was the mighty circular basket of ribs which once\n",
      "enclosed his vitals.\n",
      "\n",
      "To me this vast ivory-ribbed chest, with the long, unrelieved spine,\n",
      "extending far away from it in a straight line, not a little resembled\n",
      "the hull of a great ship new-laid upon the stocks, when only some twenty\n",
      "of her naked bow-ribs are inserted, and the keel is otherwise, for the\n",
      "time, but a long, disconnected timber.\n",
      "\n",
      "The ribs were ten on a side. The first, to begin from the neck,\n",
      "was nearly six feet long; the second, third, and fourth were each\n",
      "successively longer, till you came to the climax of the fifth, or one\n",
      "of the middle ribs, which measured eight feet and some inches. From\n",
      "that part, the remaining ribs diminished, till the tenth and last only\n",
      "spanned five feet and some inches. In general thickness, they all bore\n",
      "a seemly correspondence to their length. The middle ribs were the most\n",
      "arched. In some of the Arsacides they are used for beams whereon to lay\n",
      "footpath bridges over small streams.\n",
      "\n",
      "In considering these ribs, I could not but be struck anew with the\n",
      "circumstance, so variously repeated in this book, that the skeleton of\n",
      "the whale is by no means the mould of his invested form. The largest of\n",
      "the Tranque ribs, one of the middle ones, occupied that part of the fish\n",
      "which, in life, is greatest in depth. Now, the greatest depth of the\n",
      "invested body of this particular whale must have been at least sixteen\n",
      "feet; whereas, the corresponding rib measured but little more than eight\n",
      "feet. So that this rib only conveyed half of the true notion of the\n",
      "living magnitude of that part. Besides, for some way, where I now saw\n",
      "but a naked spine, all that had been once wrapped round with tons of\n",
      "added bulk in flesh, muscle, blood, and bowels. Still more, for the\n",
      "ample fins, I here saw but a few disordered joints; and in place of the\n",
      "weighty and majestic, but boneless flukes, an utter blank!\n",
      "\n",
      "How vain and foolish, then, thought I, for timid untravelled man to try\n",
      "to comprehend aright this wondrous whale, by merely poring over his dead\n",
      "attenuated skeleton, stretched in this peaceful wood. No. Only in the\n",
      "heart of quickest perils; only when within the eddyings of his angry\n",
      "flukes; only on the profound unbounded sea, can the fully invested whale\n",
      "be truly and livingly found out.\n",
      "\n",
      "But the spine. For that, the best way we can consider it is, with a\n",
      "crane, to pile its bones high up on end. No speedy enterprise. But now\n",
      "it's done, it looks much like Pompey's Pillar.\n",
      "\n",
      "There are forty and odd vertebrae in all, which in the skeleton are\n",
      "not locked together. They mostly lie like the great knobbed blocks on\n",
      "a Gothic spire, forming solid courses of heavy masonry. The largest,\n",
      "a middle one, is in width something less than three feet, and in depth\n",
      "more than four. The smallest, where the spine tapers away into the\n",
      "tail, is only two inches in width, and looks something like a white\n",
      "billiard-ball. I was told that there were still smaller ones, but they\n",
      "had been lost by some little cannibal urchins, the priest's children,\n",
      "who had stolen them to play marbles with. Thus we see how that the\n",

      "\n",
      "Like all sea-going ship carpenters, and more especially those belonging\n",
      "to whaling vessels, he was, to a certain off-handed, practical extent,\n",
      "alike experienced in numerous trades and callings collateral to his own;\n",
      "the carpenter's pursuit being the ancient and outbranching trunk of all\n",
      "those numerous handicrafts which more or less have to do with wood as an\n",
      "auxiliary material. But, besides the application to him of the generic\n",
      "remark above, this carpenter of the Pequod was singularly efficient in\n",
      "those thousand nameless mechanical emergencies continually recurring\n",
      "in a large ship, upon a three or four years' voyage, in uncivilized\n",
      "and far-distant seas. For not to speak of his readiness in ordinary\n",
      "duties:--repairing stove boats, sprung spars, reforming the shape of\n",
      "clumsy-bladed oars, inserting bull's eyes in the deck, or new tree-nails\n",
      "in the side planks, and other miscellaneous matters more directly\n",
      "pertaining to his special business; he was moreover unhesitatingly\n",
      "expert in all manner of conflicting aptitudes, both useful and\n",
      "capricious.\n",
      "\n",
      "The one grand stage where he enacted all his various parts so manifold,\n",
      "was his vice-bench; a long rude ponderous table furnished with several\n",
      "vices, of different sizes, and both of iron and of wood. At all times\n",
      "except when whales were alongside, this bench was securely lashed\n",
      "athwartships against the rear of the Try-works.\n",
      "\n",
      "A belaying pin is found too large to be easily inserted into its hole:\n",
      "the carpenter claps it into one of his ever-ready vices, and straightway\n",
      "files it smaller. A lost land-bird of strange plumage strays on board,\n",
      "and is made a captive: out of clean shaved rods of right-whale bone, and\n",
      "cross-beams of sperm whale ivory, the carpenter makes a pagoda-looking\n",
      "cage for it. An oarsman sprains his wrist: the carpenter concocts a\n",
      "soothing lotion. Stubb longed for vermillion stars to be painted upon\n",
      "the blade of his every oar; screwing each oar in his big vice of wood,\n",
      "the carpenter symmetrically supplies the constellation. A sailor takes\n",
      "a fancy to wear shark-bone ear-rings: the carpenter drills his ears.\n",
      "Another has the toothache: the carpenter out pincers, and clapping\n",
      "one hand upon his bench bids him be seated there; but the poor fellow\n",
      "unmanageably winces under the unconcluded operation; whirling round the\n",
      "handle of his wooden vice, the carpenter signs him to clap his jaw in\n",
      "that, if he would have him draw the tooth.\n",
      "\n",
      "Thus, this carpenter was prepared at all points, and alike indifferent\n",
      "and without respect in all. Teeth he accounted bits of ivory; heads he\n",
      "deemed but top-blocks; men themselves he lightly held for capstans. But\n",
      "while now upon so wide a field thus variously accomplished and with such\n",
      "liveliness of expertness in him, too; all this would seem to argue some\n",
      "uncommon vivacity of intelligence. But not precisely so. For nothing was\n",
      "this man more remarkable, than for a certain impersonal stolidity as\n",
      "it were; impersonal, I say; for it so shaded off into the surrounding\n",
      "infinite of things, that it seemed one with the general stolidity\n",
      "discernible in the whole visible world; which while pauselessly active\n",
      "in uncounted modes, still eternally holds its peace, and ignores you,\n",
      "though you dig foundations for cathedrals. Yet was this half-horrible\n",
      "stolidity in him, involving, too, as it appeared, an all-ramifying\n",
      "heartlessness;--yet was it oddly dashed at times, with an old,\n",
      "crutch-like, antediluvian, wheezing humorousness, not unstreaked now\n",
      "and then with a certain grizzled wittiness; such as might have served\n",
      "to pass the time during the midnight watch on the bearded forecastle\n",
      "of Noah's ark. Was it that this old carpenter had been a life-long\n",
      "wanderer, whose much rolling, to and fro, not only had gathered no moss;\n",
      "but what is more, had rubbed off whatever small outward clingings\n",
      "might have originally pertained to him? He was a stript abstract; an\n",
      "unfractioned integral; uncompromised as a new-born babe; living without\n",
      "premeditated reference to this world or the next. You might almost\n",
      "say, that this strange uncompromisedness in him involved a sort of\n",
      "unintelligence; for in his numerous trades, he did not seem to work so\n",
      "much by reason or by instinct, or simply because he had been tutored to\n",
      "it, or by any intermixture of all these, even or uneven; but merely by\n",
      "a kind of deaf and dumb, spontaneous literal process. He was a pure\n",
      "manipulator; his brain, if he had ever had one, must have early\n",
      "oozed along into the muscles of his fingers. He was like one of\n",
      "those unreasoning but still highly useful, MULTUM IN PARVO, Sheffield\n",
      "contrivances, assuming the exterior--though a little swelled--of a\n",
      "common pocket knife; but containing, not only blades of various sizes,\n",
      "but also screw-drivers, cork-screws, tweezers, awls, pens, rulers,\n",
      "nail-filers, countersinkers. So, if his superiors wanted to use the\n",

      "of him, and the screw was fast: or if for tweezers, take him up by the\n",
      "legs, and there they were.\n",
      "\n",
      "Yet, as previously hinted, this omnitooled, open-and-shut carpenter,\n",
      "was, after all, no mere machine of an automaton. If he did not have a\n",
      "common soul in him, he had a subtle something that somehow anomalously\n",
      "did its duty. What that was, whether essence of quicksilver, or a few\n",
      "drops of hartshorn, there is no telling. But there it was; and there it\n",
      "had abided for now some sixty years or more. And this it was, this same\n",

      "stretched him out in his canoe, and so left him to be floated away to\n",

      "No: he desired a canoe like those of Nantucket, all the more congenial\n",

      "with one of the paddles of his boat. All by his own request, also,\n",
      "biscuits were then ranged round the sides within: a flask of fresh water\n",
      "was placed at the head, and a small bag of woody earth scraped up in\n",
      "the hold at the foot; and a piece of sail-cloth being rolled up for a\n",
      "pillow, Queequeg now entreated to be lifted into his final bed, that he\n",
      "might make trial of its comforts, if any it had. He lay without moving\n",
      "a few minutes, then told one to go to his bag and bring out his little\n",
      "god, Yojo. Then crossing his arms on his breast with Yojo between, he\n",

      "wholly forgotten childhood those ancient tongues had been really spoken\n",
      "in their hearing by some lofty scholars. So, to my fond faith, poor Pip,\n",
      "in this strange sweetness of his lunacy, brings heavenly vouchers of all\n",

      "was led away, and the sick man was replaced in his hammock.\n",
      "\n",
      "But now that he had apparently made every preparation for death; now\n",
      "that his coffin was proved a good fit, Queequeg suddenly rallied; soon\n",
      "there seemed no need of the carpenter's box: and thereupon, when some\n",
      "expressed their delighted surprise, he, in substance, said, that the\n",
      "cause of his sudden convalescence was this;--at a critical moment, he\n",
      "had just recalled a little duty ashore, which he was leaving undone;\n",
      "and therefore had changed his mind about dying: he could not die yet,\n",
      "he averred. They asked him, then, whether to live or die was a matter of\n",
      "his own sovereign will and pleasure. He answered, certainly. In a word,\n",
      "it was Queequeg's conceit, that if a man made up his mind to live, mere\n",
      "sickness could not kill him: nothing but a whale, or a gale, or some\n",
      "violent, ungovernable, unintelligent destroyer of that sort.\n",

      "So, in good time my Queequeg gained strength; and at length after\n",
      "sitting on the windlass for a few indolent days (but eating with a\n",
      "vigorous appetite) he suddenly leaped to his feet, threw out his arms\n",
      "and legs, gave himself a good stretching, yawned a little bit, and then\n",
      "springing into the head of his hoisted boat, and poising a harpoon,\n",

      "This done, Perth was about to begin welding the twelve into one, when\n",
      "Ahab stayed his hand, and said he would weld his own iron. As, then,\n",
      "with regular, gasping hems, he hammered on the anvil, Perth passing to\n",
      "him the glowing rods, one after the other, and the hard pressed forge\n",
      "shooting up its intense straight flame, the Parsee passed silently, and\n",
      "bowing over his head towards the fire, seemed invoking some curse or\n",

      "Fashioned at last into an arrowy shape, and welded by Perth to the\n",

      "was about giving the barbs their final heat, prior to tempering them, he\n",
      "cried to Ahab to place the water-cask near.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"No, no--no water for that; I want it of the true death-temper. Ahoy,\n",
      "there! Tashtego, Queequeg, Daggoo! What say ye, pagans! Will ye give me\n",

      "baptismal blood.\n",
      "\n",
      "Now, mustering the spare poles from below, and selecting one of hickory,\n",
      "with the bark still investing it, Ahab fitted the end to the socket of\n",
      "the iron. A coil of new tow-line was then unwound, and some fathoms of\n",
      "it taken to the windlass, and stretched to a great tension. Pressing\n",
      "his foot upon it, till the rope hummed like a harp-string, then eagerly\n",
      "bending over it, and seeing no strandings, Ahab exclaimed, \"Good! and\n",
      "now for the seizings.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "At one extremity the rope was unstranded, and the separate spread yarns\n",
      "were all braided and woven round the socket of the harpoon; the pole\n",
      "was then driven hard up into the socket; from the lower end the rope\n",
      "was traced half-way along the pole's length, and firmly secured so, with\n",
      "intertwistings of twine. This done, pole, iron, and rope--like the Three\n",
      "Fates--remained inseparable, and Ahab moodily stalked away with the\n",
      "weapon; the sound of his ivory leg, and the sound of the hickory pole,\n",
      "both hollowly ringing along every plank. But ere he entered his cabin,\n",
      "light, unnatural, half-bantering, yet most piteous sound was heard. Oh,\n",
      "Pip! thy wretched laugh, thy idle but unresting eye; all thy strange\n",

      "to some one man who has the special watch of it. Because in such a\n",
      "wilderness of running rigging, whose various different relations aloft\n",
      "cannot always be infallibly discerned by what is seen of them at the\n",
      "deck; and when the deck-ends of these ropes are being every few minutes\n",

      "unprovided with a constant watchman, the hoisted sailor should by some\n",
      "carelessness of the crew be cast adrift and fall all swooping to the\n",
      "sea. So Ahab's proceedings in this matter were not unusual; the only\n",

      "only man who had ever ventured to oppose him with anything in the\n",
      "slightest degree approaching to decision--one of those too, whose\n",
      "faithfulness on the look-out he had seemed to doubt somewhat;--it was\n",
      "strange, that this was the very man he should select for his watchman;\n",

      "incommodiously close round the manned mast-heads of whalemen in these\n",
      "latitudes; one of these birds came wheeling and screaming round his head\n",
      "in a maze of untrackably swift circlings. Then it darted a thousand feet\n",
      "straight up into the air; then spiralized downwards, and went eddying\n",
      "again round his head.\n",

      "The acute policy dictating these movements was sufficiently vindicated\n",
      "at daybreak, by the sight of a long sleek on the sea directly and\n",

      "beneath him on the cap of the top-gallant-mast, so that the Indian's\n",

      "so nigh his seemingly unsuspecting prey, that his entire dazzling hump\n",
      "was distinctly visible, sliding along the sea as if an isolated thing,\n",
      "and continually set in a revolving ring of finest, fleecy, greenish\n",
      "foam. He saw the vast, involved wrinkles of the slightly projecting head\n",
      "beyond. Before it, far out on the soft Turkish-rugged waters, went\n",
      "the glistening white shadow from his broad, milky forehead, a musical\n",
      "rippling playfully accompanying the shade; and behind, the blue waters\n",
      "interchangeably flowed over into the moving valley of his steady wake;\n",
      "and on either hand bright bubbles arose and danced by his side. But\n",
      "these were broken again by the light toes of hundreds of gay fowl softly\n",

      "some flag-staff rising from the painted hull of an argosy, the tall but\n",
      "shattered pole of a recent lance projected from the white whale's back;\n",
      "and at intervals one of the cloud of soft-toed fowls hovering, and\n",
      "to and fro skimming like a canopy over the fish, silently perched and\n",
      "rocked on this pole, the long tail feathers streaming like pennons.\n",
      "\n",
      "A gentle joyousness--a mighty mildness of repose in swiftness, invested\n",
      "the gliding whale. Not the white bull Jupiter swimming away with\n",
      "ravished Europa clinging to his graceful horns; his lovely, leering\n",
      "eyes sideways intent upon the maid; with smooth bewitching fleetness,\n",
      "rippling straight for the nuptial bower in Crete; not Jove, not that\n",
      "great majesty Supreme! did surpass the glorified White Whale as he so\n",
      "divinely swam.\n",
      "\n",
      "On each soft side--coincident with the parted swell, that but once\n",
      "leaving him, then flowed so wide away--on each bright side, the whale\n",
      "shed off enticings. No wonder there had been some among the hunters who\n",
      "namelessly transported and allured by all this serenity, had ventured\n",
      "to assail it; but had fatally found that quietude but the vesture of\n",
      "tornadoes. Yet calm, enticing calm, oh, whale! thou glidest on, to all\n",

      "And thus, through the serene tranquillities of the tropical sea, among\n",
      "waves whose hand-clappings were suspended by exceeding rapture, Moby\n",
      "Dick moved on, still withholding from sight the full terrors of his\n",
      "submerged trunk, entirely hiding the wrenched hideousness of his jaw.\n",
      "But soon the fore part of him slowly rose from the water; for an instant\n",
      "his whole marbleized body formed a high arch, like Virginia's Natural\n",
      "Bridge, and warningly waving his bannered flukes in the air, the\n",
      "grand god revealed himself, sounded, and went out of sight. Hoveringly\n",
      "halting, and dipping on the wing, the white sea-fowls longingly lingered\n",
      "over the agitated pool that he left.\n",
      "\n",
      "With oars apeak, and paddles down, the sheets of their sails adrift, the\n",
      "three boats now stilly floated, awaiting Moby Dick's reappearance.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"An hour,\" said Ahab, standing rooted in his boat's stern; and he gazed\n",
      "beyond the whale's place, towards the dim blue spaces and wide wooing\n",
      "vacancies to leeward. It was only an instant; for again his eyes seemed\n",
      "whirling round in his head as he swept the watery circle. The breeze now\n",
      "freshened; the sea began to swell.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"The birds!--the birds!\" cried Tashtego.\n",
      "\n",
      "In long Indian file, as when herons take wing, the white birds were\n",
      "now all flying towards Ahab's boat; and when within a few yards began\n",
      "fluttering over the water there, wheeling round and round, with joyous,\n",
      "expectant cries. Their vision was keener than man's; Ahab could discover\n",
      "no sign in the sea. But suddenly as he peered down and down into its\n",
      "depths, he profoundly saw a white living spot no bigger than a white\n",
      "weasel, with wonderful celerity uprising, and magnifying as it rose,\n",
      "till it turned, and then there were plainly revealed two long crooked\n",
      "rows of white, glistening teeth, floating up from the undiscoverable\n",
      "bottom. It was Moby Dick's open mouth and scrolled jaw; his vast,\n",
      "shadowed bulk still half blending with the blue of the sea. The\n",
      "glittering mouth yawned beneath the boat like an open-doored marble\n",
      "tomb; and giving one sidelong sweep with his steering oar, Ahab whirled\n",
      "the craft aside from this tremendous apparition. Then, calling upon\n",
      "Fedallah to change places with him, went forward to the bows, and\n",
      "seizing Perth's harpoon, commanded his crew to grasp their oars and\n",
      "stand by to stern.\n",
      "\n",
      "Now, by reason of this timely spinning round the boat upon its axis, its\n",
      "bow, by anticipation, was made to face the whale's head while yet\n",
      "under water. But as if perceiving this stratagem, Moby Dick, with that\n",
      "malicious intelligence ascribed to him, sidelingly transplanted himself,\n",
      "as it were, in an instant, shooting his pleated head lengthwise beneath\n",
      "the boat.\n",
      "\n",
      "Through and through; through every plank and each rib, it thrilled for\n",
      "an instant, the whale obliquely lying on his back, in the manner of\n",
      "a biting shark, slowly and feelingly taking its bows full within his\n",
      "mouth, so that the long, narrow, scrolled lower jaw curled high up into\n",
      "the open air, and one of the teeth caught in a row-lock. The bluish\n",
      "pearl-white of the inside of the jaw was within six inches of Ahab's\n",
      "head, and reached higher than that. In this attitude the White Whale\n",
      "now shook the slight cedar as a mildly cruel cat her mouse. With\n",
      "unastonished eyes Fedallah gazed, and crossed his arms; but the\n",
      "tiger-yellow crew were tumbling over each other's heads to gain the\n",
      "uttermost stern.\n",
      "\n",
      "And now, while both elastic gunwales were springing in and out, as the\n",
      "whale dallied with the doomed craft in this devilish way; and from his\n",
      "body being submerged beneath the boat, he could not be darted at from\n",
      "the bows, for the bows were almost inside of him, as it were; and\n",
      "while the other boats involuntarily paused, as before a quick crisis\n",
      "impossible to withstand, then it was that monomaniac Ahab, furious with\n",
      "this tantalizing vicinity of his foe, which placed him all alive and\n",
      "helpless in the very jaws he hated; frenzied with all this, he seized\n",
      "the long bone with his naked hands, and wildly strove to wrench it from\n",
      "its gripe. As now he thus vainly strove, the jaw slipped from him; the\n",
      "frail gunwales bent in, collapsed, and snapped, as both jaws, like an\n",
      "enormous shears, sliding further aft, bit the craft completely in twain,\n",
      "and locked themselves fast again in the sea, midway between the two\n",
      "floating wrecks. These floated aside, the broken ends drooping, the crew\n",
      "at the stern-wreck clinging to the gunwales, and striving to hold fast\n",
      "to the oars to lash them across.\n",
      "\n",
      "At that preluding moment, ere the boat was yet snapped, Ahab, the first\n",
      "to perceive the whale's intent, by the crafty upraising of his head, a\n",
      "movement that loosed his hold for the time; at that moment his hand\n",
      "had made one final effort to push the boat out of the bite. But only\n",
      "slipping further into the whale's mouth, and tilting over sideways as it\n",
      "slipped, the boat had shaken off his hold on the jaw; spilled him out of\n",
      "it, as he leaned to the push; and so he fell flat-faced upon the sea.\n",
      "\n",
      "Ripplingly withdrawing from his prey, Moby Dick now lay at a little\n",
      "distance, vertically thrusting his oblong white head up and down in the\n",
      "billows; and at the same time slowly revolving his whole spindled body;\n",
      "so that when his vast wrinkled forehead rose--some twenty or more feet\n",
      "out of the water--the now rising swells, with all their confluent waves,\n",
      "dazzlingly broke against it; vindictively tossing their shivered spray\n",
      "still higher into the air.* So, in a gale, the but half baffled Channel\n",
      "billows only recoil from the base of the Eddystone, triumphantly to\n",
      "overleap its summit with their scud.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "*This motion is peculiar to the sperm whale. It receives its designation\n",
      "(pitchpoling) from its being likened to that preliminary up-and-down\n",
      "poise of the whale-lance, in the exercise called pitchpoling, previously\n",
      "described. By this motion the whale must best and most comprehensively\n",
      "view whatever objects may be encircling him.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "But soon resuming his horizontal attitude, Moby Dick swam swiftly round\n",
      "and round the wrecked crew; sideways churning the water in his vengeful\n",
      "wake, as if lashing himself up to still another and more deadly assault.\n",
      "The sight of the splintered boat seemed to madden him, as the blood of\n",
      "grapes and mulberries cast before Antiochus's elephants in the book\n",
      "of Maccabees. Meanwhile Ahab half smothered in the foam of the whale's\n",
      "insolent tail, and too much of a cripple to swim,--though he could still\n",
      "keep afloat, even in the heart of such a whirlpool as that; helpless\n",
      "Ahab's head was seen, like a tossed bubble which the least chance shock\n",
      "might burst. From the boat's fragmentary stern, Fedallah incuriously and\n",
      "mildly eyed him; the clinging crew, at the other drifting end, could not\n",
      "succor him; more than enough was it for them to look to themselves.\n",
      "For so revolvingly appalling was the White Whale's aspect, and so\n",
      "planetarily swift the ever-contracting circles he made, that he seemed\n",
      "horizontally swooping upon them. And though the other boats, unharmed,\n",
      "still hovered hard by; still they dared not pull into the eddy to\n",
      "strike, lest that should be the signal for the instant destruction of\n",
      "the jeopardized castaways, Ahab and all; nor in that case could they\n",
      "themselves hope to escape. With straining eyes, then, they remained on\n",
      "the outer edge of the direful zone, whose centre had now become the old\n",
      "man's head.\n",
      "\n",
      "Meantime, from the beginning all this had been descried from the ship's\n",
      "mast heads; and squaring her yards, she had borne down upon the scene;\n",
      "and was now so nigh, that Ahab in the water hailed her!--\"Sail on\n",
      "the\"--but that moment a breaking sea dashed on him from Moby Dick, and\n",
      "whelmed him for the time. But struggling out of it again, and chancing\n",
      "to rise on a towering crest, he shouted,--\"Sail on the whale!--Drive him\n",
      "off!\"\n",
      "\n",
      "The Pequod's prows were pointed; and breaking up the charmed circle, she\n",
      "effectually parted the white whale from his victim. As he sullenly swam\n",
      "off, the boats flew to the rescue.\n",
      "\n",
      "Dragged into Stubb's boat with blood-shot, blinded eyes, the white brine\n",
      "caking in his wrinkles; the long tension of Ahab's bodily strength did\n",
      "crack, and helplessly he yielded to his body's doom: for a time, lying\n",
      "all crushed in the bottom of Stubb's boat, like one trodden under foot\n",
      "of herds of elephants. Far inland, nameless wails came from him, as\n",
      "desolate sounds from out ravines.\n",
      "\n",
      "But this intensity of his physical prostration did but so much the more\n",
      "abbreviate it. In an instant's compass, great hearts sometimes condense\n",
      "to one deep pang, the sum total of those shallow pains kindly diffused\n",
      "through feebler men's whole lives. And so, such hearts, though summary\n",
      "in each one suffering; still, if the gods decree it, in their\n",
      "life-time aggregate a whole age of woe, wholly made up of instantaneous\n",
      "intensities; for even in their pointless centres, those noble natures\n",
      "contain the entire circumferences of inferior souls.\n",

      "continued with what is called double-banked oars. It was thus now. But\n",
      "the added power of the boat did not equal the added power of the whale,\n",
      "for he seemed to have treble-banked his every fin; swimming with a\n",
      "velocity which plainly showed, that if now, under these circumstances,\n",
      "pushed on, the chase would prove an indefinitely prolonged, if not a\n",

      "only in some one brief vicissitude. The ship itself, then, as it\n",
      "sometimes happens, offered the most promising intermediate means of\n",
      "overtaking the chase. Accordingly, the boats now made for her, and were\n",
      "soon swayed up to their cranes--the two parts of the wrecked boat having\n",
      "been previously secured by her--and then hoisting everything to her\n",

      "Here be it said, that this pertinacious pursuit of one particular whale,\n",

      "by no means unprecedented in the South sea fishery. For such is the\n",
      "wonderful skill, prescience of experience, and invincible confidence\n",
      "acquired by some great natural geniuses among the Nantucket commanders;\n",
      "that from the simple observation of a whale when last descried, they\n",
      "will, under certain given circumstances, pretty accurately foretell both\n",
      "the direction in which he will continue to swim for a time, while out of\n",
      "sight, as well as his probable rate of progression during that period.\n",

      "a coast, whose general trending he well knows, and which he desires\n",
      "shortly to return to again, but at some further point; like as this\n",

      "diligently marked, through several hours of daylight, then, when night\n",

      "proverbial evanescence of a thing writ in water, a wake, is to all\n",
      "desired purposes well nigh as reliable as the steadfast land. And as the\n",
      "mighty iron Leviathan of the modern railway is so familiarly known in\n",
      "its every pace, that, with watches in their hands, men time his rate as\n",
      "doctors that of a baby's pulse; and lightly say of it, the up train or\n",
      "the down train will reach such or such a spot, at such or such an hour;\n",

      "other Leviathan of the deep, according to the observed humor of his\n",
      "speed; and say to themselves, so many hours hence this whale will have\n",
      "gone two hundred miles, will have about reached this or that degree of\n",
      "latitude or longitude. But to render this acuteness at all successful in\n",
      "the end, the wind and the sea must be the whaleman's allies; for of what\n",
      "present avail to the becalmed or windbound mariner is the skill that\n",
      "assures him he is exactly ninety-three leagues and a quarter from his\n",
      "port? Inferable from these statements, are many collateral subtile\n",
      "matters touching the chase of whales.\n",
      "\n",
      "The ship tore on; leaving such a furrow in the sea as when a\n",

      "\n",
      "\"By salt and hemp!\" cried Stubb, \"but this swift motion of the deck\n",

      "brave fellows!--Ha, ha! Some one take me up, and launch me, spine-wise,\n",
      "on the sea,--for by live-oaks! my spine's a keel. Ha, ha! we go the gait\n",

      "worked anew. Whatever pale fears and forebodings some of them might\n",
      "have felt before; these were not only now kept out of sight through the\n",
      "growing awe of Ahab, but they were broken up, and on all sides routed,\n",
      "as timid prairie hares that scatter before the bounding bison. The hand\n",
      "of Fate had snatched all their souls; and by the stirring perils of\n",
      "the previous day; the rack of the past night's suspense; the fixed,\n",
      "unfearing, blind, reckless way in which their wild craft went plunging\n",
      "towards its flying mark; by all these things, their hearts were bowled\n",
      "along. The wind that made great bellies of their sails, and rushed the\n",

      "that unseen agency which so enslaved them to the race.\n",
      "\n",

      "directed by the long central keel; even so, all the individualities of\n",
      "the crew, this man's valor, that man's fear; guilt and guiltiness, all\n",
      "varieties were welded into oneness, and were all directed to that fatal\n",
      "goal which Ahab their one lord and keel did point to.\n",
      "\n",
      "The rigging lived. The mast-heads, like the tops of tall palms, were\n",
      "outspreadingly tufted with arms and legs. Clinging to a spar with one\n",
      "hand, some reached forth the other with impatient wavings; others,\n",
      "shading their eyes from the vivid sunlight, sat far out on the rocking\n",
      "yards; all the spars in full bearing of mortals, ready and ripe for\n",
      "their fate. Ah! how they still strove through that infinite blueness to\n",
      "seek out the thing that might destroy them!\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Why sing ye not out for him, if ye see him?\" cried Ahab, when, after\n",
      "the lapse of some minutes since the first cry, no more had been heard.\n",
      "\"Sway me up, men; ye have been deceived; not Moby Dick casts one odd jet\n",
      "that way, and then disappears.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "It was even so; in their headlong eagerness, the men had mistaken some\n",
      "other thing for the whale-spout, as the event itself soon proved; for\n",
      "hardly had Ahab reached his perch; hardly was the rope belayed to its\n",
      "pin on deck, when he struck the key-note to an orchestra, that made the\n",
      "air vibrate as with the combined discharges of rifles. The triumphant\n",
      "halloo of thirty buckskin lungs was heard, as--much nearer to the ship\n",
      "than the place of the imaginary jet, less than a mile ahead--Moby Dick\n",
      "bodily burst into view! For not by any calm and indolent spoutings; not\n",
      "by the peaceable gush of that mystic fountain in his head, did the White\n",
      "Whale now reveal his vicinity; but by the far more wondrous phenomenon\n",
      "of breaching. Rising with his utmost velocity from the furthest depths,\n",
      "the Sperm Whale thus booms his entire bulk into the pure element of\n",
      "air, and piling up a mountain of dazzling foam, shows his place to the\n",
      "distance of seven miles and more. In those moments, the torn, enraged\n",
      "waves he shakes off, seem his mane; in some cases, this breaching is his\n",
      "act of defiance.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"There she breaches! there she breaches!\" was the cry, as in his\n",
      "immeasurable bravadoes the White Whale tossed himself salmon-like to\n",
      "Heaven. So suddenly seen in the blue plain of the sea, and relieved\n",
      "against the still bluer margin of the sky, the spray that he raised, for\n",
      "the moment, intolerably glittered and glared like a glacier; and\n",
      "stood there gradually fading and fading away from its first sparkling\n",
      "intensity, to the dim mistiness of an advancing shower in a vale.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Aye, breach your last to the sun, Moby Dick!\" cried Ahab, \"thy hour and\n",
      "thy harpoon are at hand!--Down! down all of ye, but one man at the fore.\n",
      "The boats!--stand by!\"\n",
      "\n",
      "Unmindful of the tedious rope-ladders of the shrouds, the men, like\n",
      "shooting stars, slid to the deck, by the isolated backstays and\n",
      "halyards; while Ahab, less dartingly, but still rapidly was dropped from\n",
      "his perch.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Lower away,\" he cried, so soon as he had reached his boat--a spare one,\n",
      "rigged the afternoon previous. \"Mr. Starbuck, the ship is thine--keep\n",
      "away from the boats, but keep near them. Lower, all!\"\n",
      "\n",
      "As if to strike a quick terror into them, by this time being the first\n",
      "assailant himself, Moby Dick had turned, and was now coming for the\n",
      "three crews. Ahab's boat was central; and cheering his men, he told them\n",
      "he would take the whale head-and-head,--that is, pull straight up to his\n",
      "forehead,--a not uncommon thing; for when within a certain limit, such\n",
      "a course excludes the coming onset from the whale's sidelong vision.\n",
      "But ere that close limit was gained, and while yet all three boats were\n",
      "plain as the ship's three masts to his eye; the White Whale churning\n",
      "himself into furious speed, almost in an instant as it were, rushing\n",
      "among the boats with open jaws, and a lashing tail, offered appalling\n",
      "battle on every side; and heedless of the irons darted at him from every\n",
      "boat, seemed only intent on annihilating each separate plank of which\n",
      "those boats were made. But skilfully manoeuvred, incessantly wheeling\n",
      "like trained chargers in the field; the boats for a while eluded him;\n",
      "though, at times, but by a plank's breadth; while all the time, Ahab's\n",
      "unearthly slogan tore every other cry but his to shreds.\n",
      "\n",
      "But at last in his untraceable evolutions, the White Whale so crossed\n",
      "and recrossed, and in a thousand ways entangled the slack of the three\n",
      "lines now fast to him, that they foreshortened, and, of themselves,\n",
      "warped the devoted boats towards the planted irons in him; though now\n",
      "for a moment the whale drew aside a little, as if to rally for a more\n",
      "tremendous charge. Seizing that opportunity, Ahab first paid out more\n",
      "line: and then was rapidly hauling and jerking in upon it again--hoping\n",
      "that way to disencumber it of some snarls--when lo!--a sight more savage\n",
      "than the embattled teeth of sharks!\n",
      "\n",
      "Caught and twisted--corkscrewed in the mazes of the line, loose harpoons\n",
      "and lances, with all their bristling barbs and points, came flashing\n",
      "and dripping up to the chocks in the bows of Ahab's boat. Only one\n",
      "thing could be done. Seizing the boat-knife, he critically reached\n",
      "within--through--and then, without--the rays of steel; dragged in\n",
      "the line beyond, passed it, inboard, to the bowsman, and then, twice\n",
      "sundering the rope near the chocks--dropped the intercepted fagot of\n",
      "steel into the sea; and was all fast again. That instant, the White\n",
      "Whale made a sudden rush among the remaining tangles of the other lines;\n",
      "by so doing, irresistibly dragged the more involved boats of Stubb and\n",
      "Flask towards his flukes; dashed them together like two rolling husks on\n",
      "a surf-beaten beach, and then, diving down into the sea, disappeared in\n",
      "a boiling maelstrom, in which, for a space, the odorous cedar chips of\n",
      "the wrecks danced round and round, like the grated nutmeg in a swiftly\n",
      "stirred bowl of punch.\n",
      "\n",
      "While the two crews were yet circling in the waters, reaching out after\n",
      "the revolving line-tubs, oars, and other floating furniture, while\n",
      "aslope little Flask bobbed up and down like an empty vial, twitching his\n",
      "legs upwards to escape the dreaded jaws of sharks; and Stubb was lustily\n",
      "singing out for some one to ladle him up; and while the old man's\n",
      "line--now parting--admitted of his pulling into the creamy pool to\n",
      "rescue whom he could;--in that wild simultaneousness of a thousand\n",
      "concreted perils,--Ahab's yet unstricken boat seemed drawn up towards\n",
      "Heaven by invisible wires,--as, arrow-like, shooting perpendicularly\n",
      "from the sea, the White Whale dashed his broad forehead against its\n",
      "bottom, and sent it, turning over and over, into the air; till it fell\n",
      "again--gunwale downwards--and Ahab and his men struggled out from under\n",
      "it, like seals from a sea-side cave.\n",
      "\n",
      "The first uprising momentum of the whale--modifying its direction as\n",
      "he struck the surface--involuntarily launched him along it, to a little\n",
      "distance from the centre of the destruction he had made; and with his\n",
      "back to it, he now lay for a moment slowly feeling with his flukes from\n",
      "side to side; and whenever a stray oar, bit of plank, the least chip\n",
      "or crumb of the boats touched his skin, his tail swiftly drew back, and\n",
      "came sideways smiting the sea. But soon, as if satisfied that his work\n",
      "for that time was done, he pushed his pleated forehead through the\n",
      "ocean, and trailing after him the intertangled lines, continued his\n",
      "leeward way at a traveller's methodic pace.\n",
      "\n",
      "As before, the attentive ship having descried the whole fight, again\n",
      "came bearing down to the rescue, and dropping a boat, picked up the\n",
      "floating mariners, tubs, oars, and whatever else could be caught at, and\n",
      "safely landed them on her decks. Some sprained shoulders, wrists, and\n",
      "ankles; livid contusions; wrenched harpoons and lances; inextricable\n",
      "intricacies of rope; shattered oars and planks; all these were there;\n",
      "but no fatal or even serious ill seemed to have befallen any one. As\n",
      "with Fedallah the day before, so Ahab was now found grimly clinging to\n",
      "his boat's broken half, which afforded a comparatively easy float; nor\n",
      "did it so exhaust him as the previous day's mishap.\n",
      "\n",
      "But when he was helped to the deck, all eyes were fastened upon him; as\n",
      "instead of standing by himself he still half-hung upon the shoulder of\n",
      "Starbuck, who had thus far been the foremost to assist him. His ivory\n",
      "leg had been snapped off, leaving but one short sharp splinter.\n",
      "\n",

      "\"But no bones broken, sir, I hope,\" said Stubb with true concern.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Aye! and all splintered to pieces, Stubb!--d'ye see it.--But even with\n",
      "a broken bone, old Ahab is untouched; and I account no living bone of\n",

      "barbarians, and therefore their flesh more musky to the senses of the\n",
